A Better Ned Head, seems like we are all looking for a better [Ned Rig](https://ksbigbass.com/have-you-heard-of-the-ned-rig/) setup. We've all been there. That little TRD worm catches a giant bass and the hook bends, breaks, or is too small and we lose the fish of a lifetime.

Berkley Half Head is rapidly becoming a goto in my tackle box.

## So what makes a better Ned Head?

Or is it the constant snags we must endure when fishing around rocks and rip rap. Fishing the dam for smallmouth is a challenge, to say the least with the original Ned without the lightest of heads. I got things to do. Dealing with the wind blowing the lightweight jig head around isn't productive.

### The weight of the jig head is important.

The Zman plastic floats the tail of the bait of the bottom, too heavy of a jig head and that doesn't happen as well. This subtle, finesse presentation can produce quantity and quality catches, especially when the bass is pressured/finicky and unwilling to chase power fishing presentations such as crankbaits, spinner baits, topwater, and other moving baits. 

### Hooks that won't bend and large enough to catch big fish.

And a weedguard choice.

There are a few different thought patterns for weed guards.

> Each seems to have areas that are better than others and is anglers choice.

Single light wire style or the Texas rig style heads. For Finesse tactics around grass, brush, and laydowns without constant snagging and fouling the hook and spooking fish.
