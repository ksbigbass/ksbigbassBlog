Fishing is a passion for me, with well over 10,000 hours of time on the water, I still spend 100+ days a year chasing black bass.  Numerous 8+lb bass to my credit being a purely catch and release fisherman, they all swam off into the sunset.

Leave them there for the next person to enjoy as much as you did.    

I tournament fish lakes in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri the most but have fished in several states and lakes across the USA. Recently I picked up a habit of trout fishing in the pacific northwest, so watch for something new!
