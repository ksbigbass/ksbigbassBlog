Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches: Google Search Trends showed a big surge in bass fishing related search terms back in 2004 for Alaska. The graph spikes at 100. Instinct tells me this was more for a search for Rock Bass or Striped Bass versus largemouth or smallmouth bass. Either way interesting information for you to enjoy.


#### Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches



Catching giant striped bass or giant trout on a fly line would be a blast if you ask me. Can't wait for my first trip to the winding rustic rivers of Alaska to catch some giants on a Spey rod!

## Alaska saw a spike in bass fishing related terms in 2004 and has since seen less activity.

Fly fishing or using braided lines is always such a hassle. Always looking for new tools and devices that actually work as described and make my life easier somehow. Well this little knot tying tool makes that a lot easier to do.

Use it for attaching a Fluorocarbon leader to braid.
