Anybody recognize this underspin? I had found these underspins and bought a few but can't remember what brand they are. The do well at catching fish that's for sure. The hooks on these are 4/0 big wire with 3/16th weight on the outboard end of the hook shaft acting like a keel to some extent and helps with the action.

I think it was made before he passed away by Bill Dee at SOB lures but not sure about that.


Anyway I have since found some awesome underspins that give me a great hookup ratio on a small hollow belly swimbait. Early spring through fall I like to throw a swimbait for smallmouth bass and those big largemouth love to chomp them down too.
