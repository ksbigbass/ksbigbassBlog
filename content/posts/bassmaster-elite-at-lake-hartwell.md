## Topwater Action for schooling fish.

Fish are being caught on topwater walking plugs for schooling spotted bass eating blueback herring that is found in the lake. Fish are spitting up the blueback herring as the anglers are bringing them to the surface.

Pro's are turning to the Ned Rig when the schooling activity diminishes.

## Other Anglers: Chasing Spawners

Light winds are allowing the anglers to look at the fish in the clear water of Hartwell.

A few anglers have beds marked in the back of coves and are sight fishing for them. Pro Angler [Chris Johnston](http://www.bassfan.com/profile/1231/chris-johnston#.XKYIOJhKhhE), Peterborough Ontario has a big fish locked on the bed that he can see.

### Spray Bottle in Hand

Clark Wendlandt fishing for spawning fish and let's us in on a good tip about pollen being too thick on top the water to see the spawning bass.

> If there is pollen on the water you can use a spray bottle with dish soap in it to clear the water and see down below.

A few pro's have taken up smaller swimbaits and are casting them around as the wind is picking up slightly.

Tough Bite so far with smaller fish being caught in general today. That should change as the tournament progresses over the weekend.

1 Brandon Cobb 19 - 9  
2 Hank Cherry Jr 17 - 9  
2 Micah Frazier 17 - 9

#### Brandon Cobb in the lead after day 1

Brandon Cobb continue his domination of the field and stays atop the leaderboard leading into Sunday.

His total weight so far is 55.6 lbs 2nd place is Michah Frazier @ 49.12 lbs

Hank Cherry was unable to stay with the big fish and has dropped down to 8th. He still has a chance on Sunday with other the remaining 9 anglers to make the top 10, to chase down Cobb for the Win!

## Cobb Wire to Wire @ Hartwell

Hats of to Brandon Cobb. Good Job!

South Carolina's Brandon Cobb Wins his first Bassmaster Elite Series title with a four-day weight of 72.14 lbs.

Another round of spawning fish at the back of pockets off the main lake. Shallow water in 3-5 ft of water. Combination of wacky worms, topwaters, and shakey head jigs did most of his damage.
