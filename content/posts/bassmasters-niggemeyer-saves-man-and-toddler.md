They came upon a man and his toddler son in the water and their boat was still under power and heading right toward them.

"James put the boat we were in, his boat, in front of it," said Russ. "I tried to do everything I could to stop it, but it rammed James' boat."

"Russ was Johnny on the spot," said James. "It was like Baywatch, he jumped in there, killed the ignition and grabbed the boy." ....

The boy had a life jacket on, his dad didn't, according to the fishermen.

Way to Be James!! Keep up the good work!
