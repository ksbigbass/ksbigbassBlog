Big fish like big baits: Table Rock Lake is known for its spotted bass population as well as the quality largemouth and some giant smallmouth that show up from time to time. I've caught the biggest spotted bass of my life fishing there. As well as some picture worthy smallmouth. This is shaping up to be a great tournament with the largemouth bass on fire right now.

### Stacey King 

"Big fish like big baits, especially in the summertime," he said, then confirmed that he’d have thrown even larger worms if he could have found some.

#### He did his damage on tapering points that abutted the river channel.

Professional bass angler Stacey King Put a Hurtin' on the competition with a monster 13" worm.

Rig big 10 inch plus worms with a Gamakatsu EWG 5/0 or bigger hook. Use a heavier weight to get it down deep to the 20ft plus for summer fish at Table Rock. Peg it with a tungsten bass casting sinker to get the best feel of the bottom structure. Fished on a Carolina rig and weightless also works very well on deep flats or submerged humps and islands.

> Being summer time the big jigs, carolina rigged worms and lizards are great places to start with on main lake points.
