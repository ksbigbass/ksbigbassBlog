Boat Towing Gas Savers: It's important to keep the rig rolling down the road.  Small things I do that can help keep a couple dollars in my pocket.

You hear it all the time to check your tire pressure.  

### But make Sure and Check the **SPARE** on both the tow and boat!!

I run my tires close to Max. rated pressure. This gains me a few dollars at the pump...but can cause them to wear out faster!  So Don't over do it!

### 50-55 lbs is normally recommended


### Don't fill the boat up with fuel until you get to where you are going!!

You don't want to haul all that weight in fuel if it's a long drive.  Plus the fuel found around major lakes usually is better marine quality without ethanol in it.
