## Bolts to Add on a Jackplate to Ranger 519vx

Bolts to Add a Jackplate Ranger 519vx: Since I have the out for a rebuild I've decided to add a jackplate to the Ranger. Jackplate's offer adjustability to the motor height and in turn the height of the prop shaft.

### With the Optimax mounted directly to the transom there isn't any way to adjust the prop height.

The height of the jackplate controls how much prop is in the water, raise it to put less prop in the water for more control and speed or lower it to get more prop in the water and a bigger bite with a heavy load.

### Jackplate Bolts

I read that I should use Mercury Marine bolt kit to install the jackplat. This worked great for mounting the plate to the transom.

The 4 inch stainless steel ( 4 x 1/2 x 20 ) were more than long enough and I like the fine thread bolts came with nylock nuts.

### Mounting the jackplate to the motor, however, these bolts are way too long.

Here's what you need for that:

#### 2x - 1/2 x 2 1/2 x 20 - Upper bolts

#### 2x - 1/2 x 3 x 20 - Lower Bolts

The lower bolt have to go thru a thicker piece of aluminum in the jackplate and require the longer bolts to make sure to have plenty of thread past the nylock nut.

> Coarse thread bolts (x13) are easier to locate and what I found at the local hardware store and will work fine. Make sure they are stainless.


#### Torque specs are 80 ft lbs.

And of course make sure to add marine grade silicone on the thru-hull bolts to avoid any leaks.
