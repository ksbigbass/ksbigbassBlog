Buzzbait conditions: The conditions were perfect for a buzzbait bite — post-frontal with a nice chop on the water, just enough to break up the profile of my bait. It was a textbook presentation.

I want the bass to eat topwater baits but I am not sure the conditions will allow, but if it does....Wow!


## Buzzbait conditions:

### When to:

Low skies, low light, and a slightly cooler day than you've been having, the topwater bite turns on

Shallow fish are using shallow water cover, the buzzbait will flush them out.

For drawing fish out of heavy cover in both stained and clear water

Anywhere you can locate wood or vegetation

Light winds to flat calm

I prefer a single blade white or black but that's me, I sometimes will tip it with a fluke or some other type of spinnerbait trailer, but don't be afraid to run it with just the skirt and no trailer.  If you ask KVD he would always have a trailer hook on it.

## Water Temperature Guide

### Spring

Mid- to high 40s and on the upswing

### Summer

Any

### Fall

Until below about 50°F  

Topwaters that appeal to smallmouth may not necessarily appeal to largemouth.  A buzzbait,  I think is one of those lures that appeals to both species and throw spotted bass in there too for that matter.



Gotta get back to prep. Hope this helps you out on your next adventure to the lake and you get to enjoy the explosive feeling when that giant largemouth bass comes crashing out of her hiding spot and crushes that noisy critter coming overhead.
