Prep for the next tournament at Clinton Lake has begun in earnest now.

Located near Lawrence KS is the next stop for us on this adventure.  

Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass Population


Clinton Lake [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Lake_\(Kansas\))


This is a smaller lake here in KS and one that I have never been to.  This is the second tourney in a row that I have never been to the lake at least once.  Add to that, my work schedule did not permit any practice time for this event or the last for that matter.

> I had high hopes of making the 3hr drive this week to get a little look around the lake, unfortunately that was unable to take place, as of yet...
> 

This lake  has 23 different species of fish in it according to the KDWP and the Corps.  

Largemouth are more predominant

Smallmouth bass are listed in the literature after a little more digging.

I can only guess the weights to win are gonna be 15 lbs and it will be largemouth that win it.

Water temps are unclear to me right now, found 60 degrees on [Corps](https://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/Locations/District-Lakes/Clinton-Lake/) site but with 100 degree temps next 2-3 days could really heat things up!

Stay tuned ...
