## Dead or Blown Powerhead: It has happened again.

### Optimax blew up.

Dead and blown powerhead: So many of us have been there. Whether or not we get a warning buzzer that tells us or just a gut feeling, we all know when we've blown up another outboard motor.

### Table Rock Ate My Optimax

Had just put the 2004 519VX Comanche Ranger in the water at my favorite place, Table Rock lake in Missouri, when the idle of my 200hp Mercury Optimax started acting a little funny. Well it wasn't long before she lost a little power on the top end and I knew there was a real problem.

> I had to make the decision a lot of us do, fix it or replace the boat? The boat works great, I like the hull, so I decided to fix it.

### The Search

Not having a competent boat shop around me I went to the internet to find a solution to my problem. I found remanufactured motors on Ebay and other places. Found places that specialized in rebuilds but took my core and gave me someone else's. All of these solutions had mixed ratings at best.

There is of course going with a used motor, and a whole different set of questions I didn't want to answer, like having another dead powerhead in 6 months.

I decided to go with [ChrisCarsonMarine.com](https://chriscarsonmarine.com/) who will rebuild the powerhead in house, machine work included, test/fix/replace any bad air, oil, fuel injectors, and all systems before shipping it back to me.

### Being out of state he will also run the rebuilt motor on a boat to test it under a full load. Will be ready to bolt on and go!

I found Chris from favorable reviews on Bass boat central and scream and fly.
