### This weekend’s tournament is about 20 miles north of Topeka, Kansas, on Perry Lake. 

Early Fall Bass Fishing - A Plan: This will only be the second time I’ve laid eyes on Perry.  The first was last weekend when I spent about four hours on the water.  The lake is 4 feet over normal pool due to flooding downstream.

This has been the case for awhile now and there aren’t any plans to release water anytime soon.  Rumor has it the lake turned over already a few weeks ago and I sure hope that is more fact than fiction. 

> If the turnover has already occurred, the fish may be back into a normal or typical fall pattern that I can pick up on quickly.   The main river filling the lake enters in the upper end where there is a large amount of clay on the banks. 


The past few nights the area has had showers and the forecast is for that to continue through Saturday.  That can only mean dirty water and I’ll admit that is not something I want to deal with – I usually try to avoid it if I can. 

I plan to concentrate my attention on rocks and docks in a few areas out of the main dirt flow.  

## Here is a list of my pre-game lure choices. 

#### Whopper Plopper

Early fall - original Rapala Floating minnow and save the suspenders for a little later in the fall.

#### BOOYAH Counter Strike Buzz

Early in the morning and let them tell me if it's an all day gig.

Zoom Super Fluke is best fished slower than in the summer for fall fishing with more pauses and letting the lure sink deeper. Concentrate on sharper banks and depth changes.



It's a seat-of-the-pants feel for me on game day, but having a proven arsenal in mind can only do a person good.
