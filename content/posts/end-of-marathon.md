End of a Marathon: Sure we all have had one of those days.   Well today was Tourney day.   After a long day of work Friday we ended up in Lawrence around 9pm, just in time to find out it was KU's Graduation Weekend.  

## End of a Marathon: Have you ever had one of those days where things went wrong.


### The scramble was on to find a hotel room!  

First stop was a no-go, and we quickly came to the realization that we might be spending the night in the truck at the ramp.  As luck would have it the very first hotel  we called had an available room.  We promptly made it to our room after check in and settled in ready for the derby wake up at 04:30.  

### Jump ahead to the boat being backed down the ramp.  

All systems have been checked and prepped from the last trip, had spent hours fixing brakes, trolling motors, doing map study, prepping rods and baits.  Hours spent making sure everything was gonna work as described.

> N_one of that matters if you don't have the boat key._    See this is when a series of uncontrollable events happen.    


Turns out the jacket  I was using to lay on the highway and change that blown-out GoodYear Marathon....._._had the boat keys in the pocket.

#### That pocket just happened to be 3hrs away in my truck,  sitting in driveway, since we didn't use my truck to tow the boat.  


Just goes to show it's a little thing that can make or break a day.   Couldn't end the day like that,  just too bitter to swallow without a chaser.  

So..... to the local hole and found some fish on topwater today,  bagged this girl with a Rebel Pop-R.Good End to a Marathon.
