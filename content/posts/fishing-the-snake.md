Fishing the Snake: Fishing in PSNW for steelhead. With guide [Trevor Wine](https://www.worldcastanglers.com/about-wca/fly-fishing-guides/) from WCA fly Fishing we headed out early in a well equipped drift boat and ready to catch some giant trout.

My first fish from the Snake wasn't very big but it did get me excited! I can't believe how much effort goes into just getting a bite. The Snake River is a barbless sanctuary which makes things just a little bit tougher on us the anglers and better for protecting the fishery.

Excellent camera work from my brother on this 4 minute fight -- https://youtu.be/46_k6IJKjUE?si=Sh4hqYqlBQGTcLQl with this beast. At one point about 2:40 seconds into the video you can see the line get wrapped around the reel seat just as the fish was starting to make another big run. Exciting fishing that I can't wait to get back to and break that new record.

Here is a picture of that beautiful trout from the Snake River and Thank you Trever!
