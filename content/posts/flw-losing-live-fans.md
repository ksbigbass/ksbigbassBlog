Is FLW losing the race for live view fans? More importantly are they losing the fight for fans?

Social media is full of fans that want to watch live streaming bass fishing! We Love Bass Fishing! Streaming live fishing is quickly becoming an addiction for some, myself included.


## Is the FLW losing fans?

As I sit here watching both the MLF Bass Pro Tour on one screen and BASS on another I wonder, why isn't FLW broadcasting live?

BASS is at Winyah Bay with live fishing all weekend starting on Thursday.


MLF is at Chickamauga Lake and started their live broadcast Tuesday and will continue all weekend.


FLW is at Cherokee Reservoir Jefferson City, TN, and won't start live broadcasting until Saturday and then only 4 hrs. With an additional 4 hrs on Sunday. 8 full hours total.


With such a lack of on the water live streaming at a time when the competition is creating so much awesome content, will they be able to survive the future? Will they slowly drift off into irrelevancy?

> The fight for viewership is on hot and heavy between 2 not 3 it seems.
