Have you heard of Ned: Ned's Rig is a powerful finesse fishing tool for all kinds of fish and extremely different conditions.  The technique uses an ultra light mushroom head jig. Usually something like a 1/10th ounce along with a spinning rod rigged with 6 or 8lb fluorocarbon.

> This thing catches everything that swims, so you might be in for the fight of a lifetime.

>  "_There are 3 sizes of jig that we like to use for the Ned rig,” Kehde said. “At the lightest, we will throw a 1/32-ounce jig. The majority of the time, we use a 1/16-ounce jig which will cover most situations. Last, we fish a 3/32-ounce jig when it is either very windy or if we are trying to get our baits deeper._”  

### Have you heard of Ned? Using this rig you will feel like a fish catching machine!

#### Used in traditional bass habitat and cover around rocks where you might otherwise throw a texas rigged worm or drop shot.

#### Use it on riprap like a jig.

> Tip: Swim it with little hops to imitate fleeing prey.

#### The light head excels at keeping the bait out of the rock when paired with a weed guard.


If you are looking for a great bait for a young angler to enjoy and make a trip of a lifetime you need to put a ned rig on and go to town.
