### Vacuum up!

- Vacuum dry.
- Using a shop vac or a rented carpet cleaner is very important to get a great final product.
- Do your best to rinse all the shaving cream out of the carpet, the residue will create a dirty sticky mess later if not all taken care of.


### Mix fabric softener and water in a spray bottle. 

- Wait for the carpet to completely dry, then spray the carpet with the fabric softener.
- Afterward, lightly go against the grain of the carpet with a pet brush to make it stand back up as if new and smelling fresh.
