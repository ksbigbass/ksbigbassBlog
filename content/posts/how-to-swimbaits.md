https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOLpcT4nmWY

Are you new to swimbaits? Confused as to what to use or even how and when to use them? Brian breaks it all down for you in this video. The sizes to use, and when and why he does it, along with the basics in how to fish them. What is great is he is able to make a instructional video and leaves the sales pitch on the bank.
