Just a Goal…. I need to deviate from my normal fishing talk for a second.  I have been writing this blog for a few months now and am still amazed that anyone actually reads it. 

## For those of you that do, Thank You! 

I try to write fresh and unique content, concentrating on the stuff I see from TOW (time on water).  TOW is precious: it's one of those things in life that cannot be replaced with anything else.


Reading my blog, [BassMaster](https://www.bassmaster.com/), and [BassWest](http://www.basswest.com/) are going to help in your fishing, no doubt, but it's all about TOW.   Life doesn't always give us what we want and like my mom always told me, "Nobody ever said life was fair!".  

## I want to be on the water 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. 

I want to be a fishing guide at Table Rock Lake.  Some days I can see that goal coming closer and some days it just gets that much farther away.  Ike has said it best with "Never Give Up!"  and I keep his motto close to my heart.   

The 9 to 5 grind can be extremely hard on us at times and all we want to do is throw up our hands, cuss and holler, grab a fishing pole, and run to the lake. Times are tough for a lot of people right now.  

The cost of living keeps going up and paychecks aren't, which makes it a lot harder on the masses to get to the lake and get that TOW.  I know I have missed more than a weekend or two because of fuel prices, and I know I am not alone there.

#### Just A Goal

So what is this blog about now that it's almost over?  Nothing.  Just bitching about not getting that TOW.

Bitching because:

- I want my job to be meeting you at the dock at 6am tomorrow for a day on the Rock.
- I sucked in practice this weekend for the upcoming tournament.
- Now I have to think about that for 3 weeks before the tournament.
- Three weeks!!! I didn't get skunked, but boy I sure stunk that lake up pretty bad!
- I know a lot is gonna change in the next few weeks and transitioning to a fall pattern is a definite maybe.  


_TOW is precious, treat it as such._
