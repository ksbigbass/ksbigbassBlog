Transducer Wire Pinch Point Issue

1. **Add a rubber stopper to the shaft of the TM.**

2. **Find a nice big rubber grommet at Lowes and drill out the center of it just enough that the composite shaft will slide through with a little bit of effort.  
    **
    
3. **Remove the top of the TM Head and shaft from the motor.**
    
4. **Spray a little WD40 on the rubber grommet and slide it down as far as possible.**
    
5. **Re-Assemble and strap down the wire with a few zip ties.**
    

I got tired of the bottom of the mount and the top of the collar on the motor pinching and cutting very expensive transducers, I think I went through 3 before I found this fix.

Hope it helps.
