Missed a Big One: Hit a local yocal today and found quite a few Big bucks running the bank.   Had about 20 min to fish, so I had to make the best of it.

## Targeting spawning flats


Started with a custom painted Pop-r and had a nice 8 lber blow up on it.  Being my first cast of the day I choked and yanked it out of his mouth !  ARGH!!  Missed a Big One!

Being lunchtime and near high sun for the day I knew the large females would be haunting the shallow waters looking for a big meal and spot to make babies. I was right but dang it I hate it when I miss a big fish.

Ended up bagging a nice few keepers in the trip.  I did have a Nice buck show himself to me, guessing 6lbs, and I am sure he will bite my swimbait tomorrow....lol.

These new poppers by Z-Man lure the Pop Shadz are starting to make a spot in my tackle box for fishing stuff where this popper gets hung up on weeds and grass. It has a little different look than a frog or a mouse and gets some looks. Check out the [Pop Shadz](https://ksbigbass.com/z-man-pop-shadz-lures-review/) and a tip on rigging them.
