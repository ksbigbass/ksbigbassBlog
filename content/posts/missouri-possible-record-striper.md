### Cunningham, 30, of Fordland, was fishing from a boat in the upper reaches of Bull Shoals when the record fish grabbed the large plastic minnow he was casting. He was fishing in about 40 feet of water.

The fish was 47 inches long and had a girth of slightly more than 36 inches.

If Cunningham's catch holds up, Missouri's record for striped bass will have fallen three times in the last four years.

The current freshwater world-record striped bass weighed 67 pounds, 8 ounces, and came from O'Neill Forebay, a 2,250-acre reservoir near San Luis, Calif.  

#### The previous two records were a 56-pound, 5-ounce fish taken on July 13, 2008, and a 58-pound, 5-ounce fish caught on July 8, 2010.

Nice Fish James!
