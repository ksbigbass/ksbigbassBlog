## Fishing Scale: ElectroSamson Brecknell 

The MLF fishing scale: If you were wondering what that scale really looked like? This is the scale that has made the quick catch and release style tournament fishing the success it is. Now any club that wants to try and create their own MLF style tournament knows where to start.

If you like the way the MLF weighs the fish and then immediately releases it, then you are a fan of this scale.

They have modified it with a fish lip clip similar to the one below. This is a Fish Grip Jr.

Provides less chance of injury to fisherman and the fish. Made of plastic and stainless steel and floats if lost in the water, besides that it easily stows into a kayak compartment nicely.
