My name is @ksbigbass,  and as the name suggests,  I do live in Kansas and I am on the eternal search for more and Bigger bass !!

## Welcome!

While trying to teach myself how to do it Faster!  Fishing with a power finesse style that is unique to me and may not be exactly the way the magazines would tell you how to do it. 


Love to fish  Eakins Jigs  in the rocks in the local watering holes, but don't be surprised if you find me with a swimbait tied to the end of my line!  

I tournament fish lakes in Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.

 [Table Rock Lake](https://www.visittablerocklake.com/) in Missouri is my favorite lake to fish.  


I have one of the largest fish of my life that came from the great lake.  10.5lbs caught on that Eakins jig I spoke of earlier  ;-)   That lake is Full of largemouth, spotted, and smallmouth bass, and a 50 fish day is not uncommon.   Maybe one day I will guide there in the future, have you as a guest in my boat.  

I currently am the Proud owner of a 1999 Triton TR-20 with a 200hp Mercury Optimax.   Beige with a forest   green stripe and grey interior.  

Currently have a Lowrance HDS-5 at the drivers console and a Lowrance 125 at the bow.  I also run a digital Motorguide 82lb thrust that I would love to upgrade to the 109 lbs.  

Is your fish finder lying to you?

The 40mph winds that I often encounter would be better tamed with the bigger motor but the 82 lbs does fine in most conditions.
