## Newer Record Set!

New World Record Sunfish Caught: He was soaking a live nightcrawler a foot above bottom on a [drop-shot rig](https://ksbigbass.com/nrx-803s-jwr-drop-shot-rod/) in 10 feet of water on mighty Lake Havasu February 16, hoping to hook a sunfish or perhaps a bass, when something remarkably large inhaled his bait.

During spawning time Bluegills tend to construct their round nests on shallow flats protected from pounding waves and current. Males seek the inside corners of bays, dead-end creeks, and shorelines with high banks that block prevailing winds.

The peak of the initial spawn occurs progressively later at higher latitudes, though coastal areas tend to warm faster and higher elevations remain cool longer.
