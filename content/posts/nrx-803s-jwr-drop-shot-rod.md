The G. Loomis NRX 803S JWR drop shot rod and the NRX 852S JWR  have been awesome additions to my arsenal.

Both have enough flex in the tip and the right parabolic bend to launch light drop shot rigs into the wind when it's needed but these are drop shot specific rods.


## Weightless Worms

They are not the best for ned rigs or shaky heads. Grab a Mossyback or something else for that presentation that needs a hookset. These rods take surges of a fish very well, absorbs the shock immensely well.

They do excel at drop-shotting were the no hook-set is used to hook the fish.


> I have absolutely no worries when that bite comes,  these rods will perform as described,  **period.**

These rods excel at fishing weightless worms. I love to fish a weightless trick worm, especially in the spring spawn, and the NRX 803S JWR is the best rod for the job. Literally have caught hundreds, maybe thousands of fish on the 803S.

### The actions of either rod is great.  

I have fished both rods with a drop shot and caught a lot of fish with each.

If I had to choose just one,  I would not be disappointed either way.

A  Very noticeable difference between the corks on the NRX and my Mossybacks or any other rod for that matter. A very durable rod that has lasted me years of fishing and tons of joy. Extremely light so I can fish all day with them. Man, I love my DS rod.
