OMG! Smallie!!!! Was lucky enough to film an incredible smallie show this past week where we had several fish over 6 lbs and 5 fish we weighed over 5 lbs on a digital scale, all on a variety of baits from jerkbaits, jigs, cranks, and lipless cranks.

## Best Bait was the sour grape rouge, and football head jigs. I love big smallies.

This fish tipped our digital scale at 6.4 lbs of course we released all the fish. The Conservation Series nets are in a class of their own!

I absolutely love to fish for smallmouth bass. I can't wait to get an opportunity to make it up to  
 [Milwaukee, Wisconsin](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Milwaukee-Wisconsin/1416205875339580?eid=ARAPpeqWcqFIjYzCR_2LQ9iXfuhtvoumOjWBtnS0UFSQpMjdkVIoghklmjufxSZSwgUIYdVNg8cqEZ8B&timeline_context_item_type=intro_card_current_city&timeline_context_item_source=100001723559235&fref=tag) to go out with Mr. Haataja for some of these beasts! Maybe I can get him to tell me how to pronounce that last name.
