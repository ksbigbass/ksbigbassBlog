Optimax/DFI or Premium Plus? Who hasn't had that question go through their head if they own a Mercury Marine Optimax Outboard Motor.

This official letter from Mercury Marine puts an end to the debate about which oil the OptiMax should have run through its oil injectors.


## Away from the dealer and standing in front of a shelf of oil and wonder which one won't blow up your motor?

Outboards blow up. Trying to limit that is what we all attempt to do.

Here's some help.

## Mercury Marine States OptiMax/DFI is Better.

> OptiMax / DFI oil is superior oil when compared to Premium Plus.
> 
> Mercury Marine

  
OptiMax / DFI contains more additives to reduce carbon.

Nothing about added the lubricating properties being superior only creates fewer carbon deposits over the long term usage.

> OptiMax - DFI - Premium Plus can be mixed with each other.

If OptiMax/DFI is not available **use** Premium Plus tc-w3.

#### Quicksilver

Should be the last choice but better than some alternatives on the local bait shop shelf.
