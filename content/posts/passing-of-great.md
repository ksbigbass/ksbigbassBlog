S.O.B. Lures: A Passing of a Great:  
He had a zest for life and lived it the way he wanted.

## William Thomas "Bill" Dee, owner/creator of "S.O.B. Lures" formerly of Austin, Texas, passed away Wednesday, May 18th at his home in Lytle, Texas.


### Bill was a former Austin Firefighter, fire investigator for Rimkus Consulting.

He enjoyed many hobbies in his life including motocross, softball and bass fishing. His lure company allowed him to do what he loved: fish, meet people, and tell stories.

Anglers all over the USA and other parts of the world knew they could count on "S.O.B. Lures" to land the "big catch". They also knew they could contact Bill for info and advice on anything fishing. An avid storyteller, Bill's stories touched many and will be missed.

He had a zest for life and lived it the way he wanted.

Bill is survived by his wife, Lana J. Dee; children: Bridget and Brooks Elliott, Bill and Lisa Dee, Brian and Trina Dee; Grandchildren: Zachary, Grace, William, Christian, Faith, Brandalyn, Amber and Brianna; Lana's children: Heather and Brandon Davis, Lindy and Olando Amaro, Cody and Brandi Miller, George and Sherri Miller; Lana's grandchildren: Belle, Dusty, Bailey, Devan, Brandon, Allie, Madison, Kyle, Katelyn and Kaden. We love you and miss you Opa.
