Quickly and Safely Peg A Weight: I have been using these rubber bobber stoppers for a while now, and I'm finding that not a lot of people have used these great little tools.  


### The bobber stoppers attach to the line very easily.

There is a loop on the stopper with the rubber piece above it, slide your line thru the hole, the pull the plastic circular disk away from you while holding both the stopper and the rubber stopper.



- Line thru loop.

- Hold stopper and line.

- Pull.
> Multiple stoppers can be used simultaneously for heavier weights.


Different manufactures create various sizes of bobber stops and advertise according the line weight your fishing. I buy multiple sizes for spinning line and casting lines.
