Very common, unfortunately, a know bad weld exists on the early road armor trailers.[](https://www.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=ZmVlZGJhY2s6Mzc0NTE0ODkwNTUwNzk2Nl8zNzQ1MTU4MTkyMTczNzA0&av=100000289586309)

The biggest issue was with the single axle trailers for the 188’s and the 519’s but also with the tandem trailers.

This could save a life. As "new to me" owners should be aware of this important safety issue.


## 2004-2010 years mainly affected.

Check the welds on the axles see if there is any visible cracking or separation.

## Need to inspect the shackles and links!

Have the cracks welded up and repaired if you see any before your next trip.

> Ranger should have sent a notice to all owners of trailers in the affected years a detailed description on how to remove the road armor coating and a how-to for a proper inspection procedure. If not comfortable performing this inspection to take the trailer to the dealer or a competent welder.

## Not everyone has the skills to inspect welds

Some symptoms could be:

- tires wearing uneven

- hubs failing.

My advice is to have the welds checked on your trailers now before there is someone seriously injured.

I do want the owners to be aware of a potential problem and something to check before your next trip to the lake.
