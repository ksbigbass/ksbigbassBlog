## RE : Clinton Lake: I will be visiting Clinton Lake after all.

 Taking off early in the morning tomorrow to go get in some much need practice time.

The KDWP on [Clinton Lake](https://ksoutdoors.com/State-Parks/Locations/Clinton).

I have made the promise to my partner to keep my foot on the trolling motor and keep the boat moving.   Only spending enough time to get a good look with the Lowrance and then moving on to the next spot.


Although, there are more smallmouth in this lake than I previously thought,  I can only believe that the 18" slot on the Largemouth could play a huge part in the game.  A lot of guys in this derby could be out chasing the 18.+" largemouth that are rumored to be  few and far between, while the guys with a limit of smallmouth and a smaller slot of 15" but five of them.

Or maybe things are primed for a Big sack of females to be plucked off there beds.  I guess only time will tell.

If I can come close to answering just one of those questions tomorrow I will feel like I have made an accomplishment.  

Well it's time to go rerig some rods and get ready to go. I found this little tool that Kelly Jordan made up that really makes that task easier. Restringing the line through the guides and I always seem to drop the line. It falls all the way back down to the ground and makes me restart the process all over. This little tool solves that problem.
