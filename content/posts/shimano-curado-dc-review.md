## Shimano: Curado DC Review.

Have you heard about Shimano's Curado DC? A baitcasting reel from Shimano with a digital controller built into it to prevent backlashes.

Spinnerbaits and skipping jigs under boat docks are notorious for backlashes on conventional baitcasters, this reel tackles that problem.

## *The controller monitors the spool speed 1,000 times every second and applies brakes to prevent overruns.* ##


Mono Capacity - **10/120 12/110 14/90**

- Weighs 7.8 OZ
- LOW-PROFILE
- 6+1 Bearings
- 6.2 Gear Ratio
- 11 lbs Max Drag

Anglers of all skill levels will appreciate less thumbing and trouble-free casting in all conditions.

## Does it Work?


- I really like it for spinnerbaits into the wind. It does a great job at controlling reel blowups when the wind grabs a blade.

- It excels at throwing baits with some weight to them like a rattle trap, but can easily be dialed in to throw a Senko too.

### It does have a learning curve.

I tend to have a flick in my casting technique that really accelerates the spool speed at the end of the cast. This has caused headaches and terrible backlashes, maybe worse than a standard baitcaster at times. A consistent speed in casting is needed or the reel gets very mad and so will you, I would expect.

### Takes a few casts to charge the battery.

Be careful the first few casts as it needs time to charge up the battery before it works. Admittedly, I have forgotten this in the beginning and had a few nasty starts to the day.
