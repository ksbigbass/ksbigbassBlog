Lake Fork Date Line: Early days video of Matt Allen of Tactical Bassin' and his [guide](https://ksbigbass.com/become-a-paa-observer/), putting the hammer to the big fish. Matt loses a giant in the trees, backs it up with a 12 lber then finishes off with a 7+ ! What a day on the lake for this guy!

Hard to tell from the video what baits they were using but the last fish shows Matt catches it on what appears to be a 12 in Zoom Ol' Monster Worm.
