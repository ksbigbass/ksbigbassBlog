What is Spey Fishing? Spey casts are change of direction casts that utilize water tension and allow you to cast from a downstream position to an upstream position without having to make a backcast. Great for making long casts around cover and obstacles.



### What is Spey Fishing? Spey - 2 handed fly fishing

The most common Spey casts include the Single Spey

Spey cast was developed so one could successfully cast on a large river such as the [River Spey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Spey) in Scotland.

When Spey casting was introduced, 22-foot rods were used.


### Today, rods are only 12 to 15 feet in length, and can toss a line up to 80 feet
