## What's on that graph? We have all said that one.

What's on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken....


Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.

### How to: Schooling summer fish on our graphs.

Most pics are courtesy of @LTBama wherever he is now. Thank You.

I prefer a basic metal spoon or a drop shot rig for this technique and 8 lb Seaguar Tatsu.

Cabela's RealImage Jig-N-Spoon works extremely well.

> Tip: The glow color is great fish catcher.

Here is a fish being caught.

The two zigzag lines are the anglers fishing line and his bait.

The darker object is a fish, eating his drop shot rig.


### Images to show how to fish underneath the boat.

With the boat sitting in 32.1 ft of water

64.6 degree water temp

This fish bites a spoon at 19 ft and then struggles during the fight to the surface with the lines coming to the surface.

#### Spaghetti Looking Lines

This is fish everywhere. Swimming fast through the graphs transducer.

Chasing bait. This are the types of pictures that clearly show pandamonium. The bass are actively chasing the bait and feeding heavily in this picture. Just getting a spoon to them almost guarantees a bite in these frothy conditions.

More schooling fish with a little more clarity.

Look close for the anglers spoon entering into the picture just off center to the right.

Seeing this kind of striping on the graph presents anglers with an excellent opportunity.

#### Shad pinned to the bottom via the grey box on the bottom left. Large boomerangs shapes above and to the right are bass.

The hovering big boomerangs are bass that have a large group of shad pinned close to the bottom of the lake.

Group of shad between 20 to 25 ft down being attacked by bass from 10 to 30 ft down.

Water temp is 62.5 signaling it was fall during this schooling activity.

Similar positioning of the bass.

Great spot! Drop a spoon or drop shot or even a rattle trap type bait.

These are hungry bass waiting to feed. The have the shad hovering near the bottom in a tight school for defense.

A dozen or so bass are just sitting above them waiting for the diner bell. Anglers may try to get this school to feed with a presentation and might fire the school up, but currently there isn't much action here.

Here is a creek channel.

Notice how the bass are at 26 ft with some bait shad above them.

Water temps are 82.4 degrees.

The graph is more than likely picking up on the [thermocline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocline) the bass are suspending just above.

Well there ya go.

Over the past few years there have been tremendous advances in these fish graphs. New manufacturers entering the market and new technologies coming along frequently. Before a boat may have a Lowrance X68 and be good for 5 years or so.

Now new models that are bigger and faster arrive weekly it feels like.

Fish finders will continue to advance. New technologies are being developed daily. Bright new colors and even sports or weather on them now if you want. New features, old gig.

I've included a link below for the latest software updates for your fish finders, or get a [new Lowrance](https://amzn.to/2HVybHI) today, now that you know what your looking at.

That is a fish! That's what's on that graph!
