<p>When the air temps are chilly or downright cold you might be missing out on some big bass opportunities if you are not on the water. While their out hunting, you can have the lake and giant bass all to yourself.</p>
<p>Big bass like cold water. If you go back through the record books and analyze the time of year that most of the giant bass entries are made, the water is cold more times than not. It goes to show that in the spring or in the winter the biggest bass are more available to those anglers willing to put the time in when the temps are uncomfortable.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&hellip;.</p>
<p>Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.</p>

<p>And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.</p>
<p>This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?</p>

      <p>Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches: Google Search Trends showed a big surge in bass fishing related search terms back in 2004 for Alaska. The graph spikes at 100.

<p>Buddy Tournament Fishing is it for You?</p>
<p>The past few years I’ve been fishing <a href="http://www.ksbuddybass.com/">buddy tournaments</a>. I went into fishing these buddy tournaments with apprehension.</p>
<p>Would they be good ‘ole boys with a case of Bud in one hand and Zebco in the other or would they be guys as competitive as me? Let me tell you, I was happy to find out these guys are ultra-competitive. They’ll put a whoopin’ on you in a heartbeat and not think twice about it.</p>

<p>When the lake that you are fishing goes for miles and miles, with a lot of the same structure or cover, you have to look for something special.

When confronted with a bluff wall 2 miles long or a lake filled with them, to find fish, I find the river channel.</p>

<p>The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.</p>

<p>This is a smaller lake here in KS and one that I have never been to.  This is the second tourney in a row that I have never been to the lake at least once.  Add to that, my work schedule did not permit any practice time for this event or the last for that matter.</p>
