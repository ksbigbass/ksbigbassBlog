She&amp;rsquo;s trying to get all cleaned up and get back in the game, but she&amp;rsquo;s always kinda been the 3rd choice anyway&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big bully bought off one of them, stole half of the other&amp;rsquo;s stuff, just like he does with his baits, and is attempting to take over the pond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cold-water-is-your-friend-when-hunting-for-big-largemouth-bass&#34;&gt;The cold water is your friend when hunting for big largemouth bass.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winter largemouth bass fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cold-water-means-big-fish&#34;&gt;Cold Water means big fish.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the air temps are chilly or downright cold you might be missing out on some big bass opportunities if you are not on the water. While their out hunting, you can have the lake and giant bass all to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big bass like cold water. If you go back through the record books and analyze the time of year that most of the giant bass entries are made, the water is cold more times than not. It goes to show that in the spring or in the winter the biggest bass are more available to those anglers willing to put the time in when the temps are uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very common, unfortunately, a know bad weld exists on the early road armor trailers.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=ZmVlZGJhY2s6Mzc0NTE0ODkwNTUwNzk2Nl8zNzQ1MTU4MTkyMTczNzA0&amp;amp;av=100000289586309&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue was with the single axle trailers for the 188’s and the 519’s but also with the tandem trailers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could save a life. As &amp;ldquo;new to me&amp;rdquo; owners should be aware of this important safety issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2004-2010-years-mainly-affected&#34;&gt;2004-2010 years mainly affected.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broken Trailer Axle on this Ranger 520 bass boat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check the welds on the axles see if there is any visible cracking or separation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is FLW losing the race for live view fans? More importantly are they losing the fight for fans?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Social media is full of fans that want to watch live streaming bass fishing! We Love Bass Fishing! Streaming live fishing is quickly becoming an addiction for some, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-the-flw-losing-fans&#34;&gt;Is the FLW losing fans?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I sit here watching both the MLF Bass Pro Tour on one screen and BASS on another I wonder, why isn&amp;rsquo;t FLW broadcasting live?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-on-that-graph-we-have-all-said-that-one&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s on that graph? We have all said that one.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlf-or-bass-or-flw-the-new-season-is-here&#34;&gt;MLF or BASS or FLW: The new season is here!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&amp;rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches: Google Search Trends showed a big surge in bass fishing related search terms back in 2004 for Alaska. The graph spikes at 100. Instinct tells me this was more for a search for Rock Bass or Striped Bass versus largemouth or smallmouth bass. Either way interesting information for you to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;alaska-number-1-in-bass-fishing-searches&#34;&gt;Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Catching giant striped bass or giant trout on a fly line would be a blast if you ask me. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for my first trip to the winding rustic rivers of Alaska to catch some giants on a Spey rod!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bluffed Again:How I fish bluff walls for bass: With all of the advances in electronics these days it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lazy, and use the map in your Lowrance Elite-12 or the Hummingbird in your dash. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, these are invaluable pieces of technology that help anglers find the fish, especially with the newer side and down imaging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;river-channel&#34;&gt;River Channel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the lake that you are fishing goes for miles and miles, with a lot of the same structure or cover, you have to look for something special. With docks it could be the front left corner or the ones with ladders that put a pattern together. When confronted with a bluff wall 2 miles long or a lake filled with them, to find fish, I find the river channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The G. Loomis NRX 803S JWR drop shot rod and the NRX 852S JWR  have been awesome additions to my arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both have enough flex in the tip and the right parabolic bend to launch light drop shot rigs into the wind when it&amp;rsquo;s needed but these are drop shot specific rods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;weightless-worms&#34;&gt;Weightless Worms&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are not the best for ned rigs or shaky heads. Grab a Mossyback or something else for that presentation that needs a hookset. These rods take surges of a fish very well, absorbs the shock immensely well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go Eat a Bird!!! Bought a Save Phace now I am glad I did after reading a friends blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;End of a Marathon: Sure we all have had one of those days.   Well today was Tourney day.   After a long day of work Friday we ended up in Lawrence around 9pm, just in time to find out it was KU&amp;rsquo;s Graduation Weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;end-of-a-marathon-have-you-ever-had-one-of-those-days-where-things-went-wrong&#34;&gt;End of a Marathon: Have you ever had one of those days where things went wrong.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-scramble-was-on-to-find-a-hotel-room&#34;&gt;The scramble was on to find a hotel room!  &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First stop was a no-go, and we quickly came to the realization that we might be spending the night in the truck at the ramp.  As luck would have it the very first hotel  we called had an available room.  We promptly made it to our room after check in and settled in ready for the derby wake up at 04:30.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buzzbait conditions: The conditions were perfect for a buzzbait bite — post-frontal with a nice chop on the water, just enough to break up the profile of my bait. It was a textbook presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want the bass to eat topwater baits but I am not sure the conditions will allow, but if it does&amp;hellip;.Wow!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;buzzbait-conditions&#34;&gt;Buzzbait conditions:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-to&#34;&gt;When to:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Low skies, low light, and a slightly cooler day than you&amp;rsquo;ve been having, the topwater bite turns on&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Most often the fish are related to the area because of contours and depth or time of year, the trees just happen to be cover for them.
