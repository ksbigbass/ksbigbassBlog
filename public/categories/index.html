<p>Big bass like cold water. If you go back through the record books and analyze the time of year that most of the giant bass entries are made, the water is cold more times than not. It goes to show that in the spring or in the winter the biggest bass are more available to those anglers willing to put the time in when the temps are uncomfortable.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&hellip;.</p>
<p>Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.</p>

<p>And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.</p>
<p>This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?</p>

      <p>Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches: Google Search Trends showed a big surge in bass fishing related search terms back in 2004 for Alaska. The graph spikes at 100.

<p>The past few years I’ve been fishing <a href="http://www.ksbuddybass.com/">buddy tournaments</a>. I went into fishing these buddy tournaments with apprehension.</p>
<p>Would they be good ‘ole boys with a case of Bud in one hand and Zebco in the other or would they be guys as competitive as me? Let me tell you, I was happy to find out these guys are ultra-competitive. They’ll put a whoopin’ on you in a heartbeat and not think twice about it.</p>

<p>When the lake that you are fishing goes for miles and miles, with a lot of the same structure or cover, you have to look for something special. With docks it could be the front left corner or the ones with ladders that put a pattern together.

<p>The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.</p>

Check out what Todd has to offer you for your next adventure to that tree riddled lake and endless list of targets.</p>

<p>The ordinary objects of resin, fiberglass thread, and bits of steel when combined can be used as an extraordinary tool to provide food for a family or it can transform a life through incommensurable ways.</p>
<p>The origin of the fishing pole dates back about as far as history itself, first depicted in stone inscriptions found in Egypt, China, and Medieval England. Made from cane growing beside the river, a line was fashioned to the tip with a hook fabricated out of bone and tied to the end. Small worms, insects, minnows and frogs from the river were used as bait. Cane poles are as flexible as a gymnast and strong as an ox and can be made very long to reach farther out into the river with the bait. They were so productive at catching fish they are still sold at your local Walmart.</p>

<p>Within minutes of launching my boat at the Shell Knob Bridge I had begun the onslaught.  Only took 30 minutes and I had 20 fish in my boat using a live worms drop-shotted around the pylons. Tried getting it down to 25 foot but usually only made it 12ft or so before I had a 14-18&quot; spotted bass well hooked.</p>

      <p>I am always learning how to fish.  Always.  It never fails: anytime I think I am starting to figure out how to bass fish, the bass tell me different. I&rsquo;m sure we all go through it in one way or another.  Is it that we are off our game?   Or are the bass learning the rules of the game?</p>

<p>There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.</p>

<p>The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&hellip;.</p>
<p>Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.</p>

<p>There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them.

<p>The ordinary objects of resin, fiberglass thread, and bits of steel when combined can be used as an extraordinary tool to provide food for a family or it can transform a life through incommensurable ways.</p>
<p>The origin of the fishing pole dates back about as far as history itself, first depicted in stone inscriptions found in Egypt, China, and Medieval England. Made from cane growing beside the river, a line was fashioned to the tip with a hook fabricated out of bone and tied to the end. Small worms, insects, minnows and frogs from the river were used as bait. Cane poles are as flexible as a gymnast and strong as an ox and can be made very long to reach farther out into the river with the bait. They were so productive at catching fish they are still sold at your local Walmart.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&hellip;.</p>
<p>Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.</p>

<p>The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.</p>

      <p>Chatterbaits for Spawn time largemouth bass fishing. Finding active fish willing to bite a moving bait is very productive in the spring. Fish are shallow and can be very aggressive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take advantage of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Largemouth bass want to spawn in water that is <strong>shallow 3-5 ft</strong> is common but with stable water conditions, they may have as little as 6 inches over their heads.</p>
<p><img src="/images/laydown-in-back-of-cove.jpg" alt="laydown"></p>
<p>Often they want a piece of cover to hide in or around to go with it. A laydown or logs or virtually any stick or piece of cover in the backs of creeks and coves has the potential to hold a giant bass.</p>

<p>There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.</p>

<p>The trick worm is almost always rigged weightless and wacky style when I fish it. I prefer to use Seaguar Finesse 6.2 lb line to get the absolute perfect presentation. Cast out and let the worm sink, watching the line for a strike indication at all times. Often times a very subtle twitch will cause the ends of the worm to flair every so slightly and an absolute natural looking presentation.</p>

      <p>Z-MAN Pop Shadz Lures Review: This bait has a tendency to want to walk around on the hook. The trick to rigging this bait is to use a toothpick through the eye of the hook to hold it in place. This eliminates the bait moving around and causing headaches and anger.</p>
<h2 id="z-man-pop-shadz-lures-is-the-latest-in-weedless-topwaters">Z-MAN Pop Shadz Lures is the latest in weedless topwaters.</h2>
<p>Once the issue of the bait sliding down is resolved it will produce some nice fish for you. The weedless design makes it easy to throw it in areas you might be hesitant to throw a popper type bait with dangling treble hooks catching everything but bass. The Z-Man elastic design is tough and floats well. Very durable for sure. The light weight however can cause headaches casting into the wind on casting gear. The new Shimano Curado DC and its digital micro controller for the spool speed definitely helps out on backlashes for that situation.</p>

<p>There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.</p>

<p>The Hotter the Better: Today was the hottest day on record in the area of Kansas that I live in.</p>
<p>As you can see by the picture it got to 115 degrees!  Not sure where you are from or have been but that is hot as hot gets in KS.  A few records we broken today as well as record numbers of 100+ days in a row. I did not have a surface water temp gauge with me but can only assume it was bath water warm.</p>

      <p>Re:The Hotter The Better: I fish all year round, weather conditions of all types. Here in Kansas, my current stomping grounds, the winters can be brutally cold, and the summers are hot. Tomorrow&rsquo;s forecast is 110 degrees with 80%+ humidity..aaarrggghhh. A lot of the summer bass fishing articles talk about going deep, not this one. I am going to talk about fishing shallow with 90+ degree surface water temps.</p>
<h2 id="946-degrees">94.6 degrees</h2>
<p>That was the surface water temp last weekend, air temps where 106+ during the day and already 86 degrees at 5am on our way to the lake.  It was gonna be an extremely hot day but with a 20mph wind to help it would be bearable.  Hydration is talked about a lot for a good reason!  A day like that without a gallon of Gatorade in you and a severe heat stroke situation is truly possible.  I haven&rsquo;t seen to many hospitals located lake side either&hellip;just a friendly reminder&hellip;Drink UP!  Might just save your life.  Back to the story and off the soap box.</p>

<p>Wilson lake in Kansas is a very beautiful lake. It is surrounded by sandstone cliffs on a few sides and has sloping banks with easy shore access at other points, making it a popular recreation destination for many people in the region.</p>
<p>WIth ultra clear water, someone could switch this out with the pool water at your house and you’d never know, except having smallmouth in your pool. Lol. Now this lake has all kinds of fish in it. It’s loaded with striped bass, hybrid bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and walleye too. I have spent hours catching striped bass and hybrids on virtually every cast in the summer months when they are feeding heavily on shad and creating topwater boils. There is a cliff for hang gliding, and mountain bike trails all around the lake which sponsor races year round.</p>

<h2 id="so-i-ask__how-often-are-you-throwing-baits-that-imitate-sunfish">So I ask _&hellip;_How often are you throwing baits that imitate sunfish?</h2>
<p>There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.</p>
