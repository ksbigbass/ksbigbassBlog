<p>What&rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&hellip;.</p>
<p>Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.</p>

      <p>Prep for the next tournament at Clinton Lake has begun in earnest now.</p>
<p>Located near Lawrence KS is the next stop for us on this adventure.  </p>

<p>Clinton Lake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Lake_(Kansas)">Wiki</a></p>
<p>This is a smaller lake here in KS and one that I have never been to.  This is the second tourney in a row that I have never been to the lake at least once.  Add to that, my work schedule did not permit any practice time for this event or the last for that matter.</p>
