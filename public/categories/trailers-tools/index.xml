      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very common, unfortunately, a know bad weld exists on the early road armor trailers.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=ZmVlZGJhY2s6Mzc0NTE0ODkwNTUwNzk2Nl8zNzQ1MTU4MTkyMTczNzA0&amp;amp;av=100000289586309&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue was with the single axle trailers for the 188’s and the 519’s but also with the tandem trailers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could save a life. As &amp;ldquo;new to me&amp;rdquo; owners should be aware of this important safety issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2004-2010-years-mainly-affected&#34;&gt;2004-2010 years mainly affected.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broken Trailer Axle on this Ranger 520 bass boat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check the welds on the axles see if there is any visible cracking or separation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;End of a Marathon: Sure we all have had one of those days.   Well today was Tourney day.   After a long day of work Friday we ended up in Lawrence around 9pm, just in time to find out it was KU&amp;rsquo;s Graduation Weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;end-of-a-marathon-have-you-ever-had-one-of-those-days-where-things-went-wrong&#34;&gt;End of a Marathon: Have you ever had one of those days where things went wrong.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-scramble-was-on-to-find-a-hotel-room&#34;&gt;The scramble was on to find a hotel room!  &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First stop was a no-go, and we quickly came to the realization that we might be spending the night in the truck at the ramp.  As luck would have it the very first hotel  we called had an available room.  We promptly made it to our room after check in and settled in ready for the derby wake up at 04:30.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
