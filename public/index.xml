While their out hunting, you can have the lake and giant bass all to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big bass like cold water. If you go back through the record books and analyze the time of year that most of the giant bass entries are made, the water is cold more times than not. It goes to show that in the spring or in the winter the biggest bass are more available to those anglers willing to put the time in when the temps are uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;fishing-for-a-smile&#34;&gt;Fishing for a smile&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ordinary objects of resin, fiberglass thread, and bits of steel when combined can be used as an extraordinary tool to provide food for a family or it can transform a life through incommensurable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the fishing pole dates back about as far as history itself, first depicted in stone inscriptions found in Egypt, China, and Medieval England. Made from cane growing beside the river, a line was fashioned to the tip with a hook fabricated out of bone and tied to the end. Small worms, insects, minnows and frogs from the river were used as bait. Cane poles are as flexible as a gymnast and strong as an ox and can be made very long to reach farther out into the river with the bait. They were so productive at catching fish they are still sold at your local Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very common, unfortunately, a know bad weld exists on the early road armor trailers.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ufi/reaction/profile/browser/?ft_ent_identifier=ZmVlZGJhY2s6Mzc0NTE0ODkwNTUwNzk2Nl8zNzQ1MTU4MTkyMTczNzA0&amp;amp;av=100000289586309&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue was with the single axle trailers for the 188’s and the 519’s but also with the tandem trailers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could save a life. As &amp;ldquo;new to me&amp;rdquo; owners should be aware of this important safety issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2004-2010-years-mainly-affected&#34;&gt;2004-2010 years mainly affected.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broken Trailer Axle on this Ranger 520 bass boat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check the welds on the axles see if there is any visible cracking or separation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is FLW losing the race for live view fans? More importantly are they losing the fight for fans?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Social media is full of fans that want to watch live streaming bass fishing! We Love Bass Fishing! Streaming live fishing is quickly becoming an addiction for some, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-the-flw-losing-fans&#34;&gt;Is the FLW losing fans?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I sit here watching both the MLF Bass Pro Tour on one screen and BASS on another I wonder, why isn&amp;rsquo;t FLW broadcasting live?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chatterbaits for Spawn time largemouth bass fishing. Finding active fish willing to bite a moving bait is very productive in the spring. Fish are shallow and can be very aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Largemouth bass want to spawn in water that is &lt;strong&gt;shallow 3-5 ft&lt;/strong&gt; is common but with stable water conditions, they may have as little as 6 inches over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/laydown-in-back-of-cove.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;laydown&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often they want a piece of cover to hide in or around to go with it. A laydown or logs or virtually any stick or piece of cover in the backs of creeks and coves has the potential to hold a giant bass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We have all said that one.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph. Takes a licken&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Learn what to look for on your fishfinders during the summer to find active fish that are readily available to bite. Once a school gets excited the action can last for hours. Actual pictures of on the water fish catches on the screen, just like a video game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Spey Fishing?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is Spey Fishing? Spey casts are change of direction casts that utilize water tension and allow you to cast from a downstream position to an upstream position without having to make a backcast. Great for making long casts around cover and obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-spey-fishing-spey---2-handed-fly-fishing&#34;&gt;What is Spey Fishing? Spey - 2 handed fly fishing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most common Spey casts include the Single Spey&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Double Spey&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Circle/Snap-T&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snake Roll&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;with-these-casts-an-angler-will-be-able-to-make-a-cast-in-any-river-position-and-in-any-wind-condition&#34;&gt;With these casts, an angler will be able to make a cast in any river position and in any wind condition.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spey casting originated in the heart of Scotland in the mid-1800s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlf-or-bass-or-flw-the-new-season-is-here&#34;&gt;MLF or BASS or FLW: The new season is here!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&amp;rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of Ned: Ned&amp;rsquo;s Rig is a powerful finesse fishing tool for all kinds of fish and extremely different conditions.  The technique uses an ultra light mushroom head jig. Usually something like a 1/10th ounce along with a spinning rod rigged with 6 or 8lb fluorocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This thing catches everything that swims, so you might be in for the fight of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-importantly-have-you-heard-of-neds-rig&#34;&gt;More importantly have you heard of Ned&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;rig?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/nedrig.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ned rig&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/z-man-pop-shadz-lures-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Z-MAN Pop Shadz Lures Review: This bait has a tendency to want to walk around on the hook. The trick to rigging this bait is to use a toothpick through the eye of the hook to hold it in place. This eliminates the bait moving around and causing headaches and anger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;z-man-pop-shadz-lures-is-the-latest-in-weedless-topwaters&#34;&gt;Z-MAN Pop Shadz Lures is the latest in weedless topwaters.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the issue of the bait sliding down is resolved it will produce some nice fish for you. The weedless design makes it easy to throw it in areas you might be hesitant to throw a popper type bait with dangling treble hooks catching everything but bass. The Z-Man elastic design is tough and floats well. Very durable for sure. The light weight however can cause headaches casting into the wind on casting gear. The new Shimano Curado DC and its digital micro controller for the spool speed definitely helps out on backlashes for that situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tried getting it down to 25 foot but usually only made it 12ft or so before I had a 14-18&amp;quot; spotted bass well hooked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Docks or other cover close by is always a plus but isn&amp;rsquo;t always a must have. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;chase-the-river-channel&#34;&gt;Chase the river channel.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I always look for creeks that have the main river channel close to the mouth a confluence of both the creek and river channel is a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 Tips for plastic baits in the Wind.</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/3-tips-for-plastic-baits-in-the-wind/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/3-tips-for-plastic-baits-in-the-wind/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fishing into the wind does a lot of things for the angler, but I think the most important is the minimization of the bow in the fishing line created by the wind.  Fishing with the wind can create as much bow in the line as fishing perpendicular to the wind, only problem is that it is far less noticeable to the angler and much harder to detect. It may be overcome with going with a heavier weighted bait, but this has its own inherent problems. Like these at Stockton in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Rig This has been the rage for the last few months and has won a lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the biggest tournaments on the FLW trail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;aka-umbrella-rig&#34;&gt;AKA: Umbrella Rig&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All sorts of shapes and sizes of this combination are coming into play.  Saltwater guys will recognize this as a traditional umbrella rig that has been downsized for the black bass species. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Multiple baits create a small school of prey that appear to be wounded or 1 big easy meal!  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I prefer to use Seaguar Finesse 6.2 lb line to get the absolute perfect presentation. Cast out and let the worm sink, watching the line for a strike indication at all times. Often times a very subtle twitch will cause the ends of the worm to flair every so slightly and an absolute natural looking presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cool rains are filling those lakes and ponds that almost gave their lives this year.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kansas has been in a bad drought for a while and most of the lakes in KS have really taken it hard, so every little bit of rain is a graciously appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As those cold fall rains make it to the lakes, I think about the cooling waters and the fall jerkbait fishing that I find so fun.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I thought a Lowrance sonar video set would be appropriate for the blog this week.  Headed to Stockton Lake, Mo for this years championship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a 2 day event on a lake I have never been to before but know it&amp;rsquo;s been off limits for the past 30 days so no one else should have been either.  A lake this size and only 20 boats that made the championship, and the bumper boat session of last months small pond fiasco isn&amp;rsquo;t gonna happen!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches: Google Search Trends showed a big surge in bass fishing related search terms back in 2004 for Alaska. The graph spikes at 100. Instinct tells me this was more for a search for Rock Bass or Striped Bass versus largemouth or smallmouth bass. Either way interesting information for you to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;alaska-number-1-in-bass-fishing-searches&#34;&gt;Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Catching giant striped bass or giant trout on a fly line would be a blast if you ask me. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for my first trip to the winding rustic rivers of Alaska to catch some giants on a Spey rod!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Re:The Hotter The Better: I fish all year round, weather conditions of all types. Here in Kansas, my current stomping grounds, the winters can be brutally cold, and the summers are hot. Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s forecast is 110 degrees with 80%+ humidity..aaarrggghhh. A lot of the summer bass fishing articles talk about going deep, not this one. I am going to talk about fishing shallow with 90+ degree surface water temps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;946-degrees&#34;&gt;94.6 degrees&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was the surface water temp last weekend, air temps where 106+ during the day and already 86 degrees at 5am on our way to the lake.  It was gonna be an extremely hot day but with a 20mph wind to help it would be bearable.  Hydration is talked about a lot for a good reason!  A day like that without a gallon of Gatorade in you and a severe heat stroke situation is truly possible.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen to many hospitals located lake side either&amp;hellip;just a friendly reminder&amp;hellip;Drink UP!  Might just save your life.  Back to the story and off the soap box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is surrounded by sandstone cliffs on a few sides and has sloping banks with easy shore access at other points, making it a popular recreation destination for many people in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WIth ultra clear water, someone could switch this out with the pool water at your house and you’d never know, except having smallmouth in your pool. Lol. Now this lake has all kinds of fish in it. It’s loaded with striped bass, hybrid bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and walleye too. I have spent hours catching striped bass and hybrids on virtually every cast in the summer months when they are feeding heavily on shad and creating topwater boils. There is a cliff for hang gliding, and mountain bike trails all around the lake which sponsor races year round.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bluffed Again:How I fish bluff walls for bass: With all of the advances in electronics these days it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lazy, and use the map in your Lowrance Elite-12 or the Hummingbird in your dash. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, these are invaluable pieces of technology that help anglers find the fish, especially with the newer side and down imaging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;river-channel&#34;&gt;River Channel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the lake that you are fishing goes for miles and miles, with a lot of the same structure or cover, you have to look for something special. With docks it could be the front left corner or the ones with ladders that put a pattern together. When confronted with a bluff wall 2 miles long or a lake filled with them, to find fish, I find the river channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The G. Loomis NRX 803S JWR drop shot rod and the NRX 852S JWR  have been awesome additions to my arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both have enough flex in the tip and the right parabolic bend to launch light drop shot rigs into the wind when it&amp;rsquo;s needed but these are drop shot specific rods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;weightless-worms&#34;&gt;Weightless Worms&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are not the best for ned rigs or shaky heads. Grab a Mossyback or something else for that presentation that needs a hookset. These rods take surges of a fish very well, absorbs the shock immensely well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go Eat a Bird!!! Bought a Save Phace now I am glad I did after reading a friends blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The hooks on these are 4/0 big wire with 3/16th weight on the outboard end of the hook shaft acting like a keel to some extent and helps with the action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/IMG00422-20110512-1302.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;underspin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Underspin with White Zoom Super Fluke&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Underspin. Here&amp;rsquo;s a better look. Turns out I was ahead of the curve on this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bassmaster.com/anglers/casey-ashley&#34;&gt;Casey Ashley&lt;/a&gt; won the Bassmaster Classic on a very similar bait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Missed a Big One: Hit a local yocal today and found quite a few Big bucks running the bank.   Had about 20 min to fish, so I had to make the best of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;targeting-spawning-flats&#34;&gt;Targeting spawning flats&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started with a custom painted Pop-r and had a nice 8 lber blow up on it.  Being my first cast of the day I choked and yanked it out of his mouth !  ARGH!!  Missed a Big One!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video of 40+mph wind Milford Lake Kansas: With our boat launching for a tournament right here at this boat ramp a few hours later, we watched in horror as the waves came crashing in. More rain and storms continued overnight causing the water levels to rise, cool the water off, and muddy things up. What could be better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Milford Lake one of Kansas&amp;rsquo;s biggest lakes makes it very angry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hylBi6ohePI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/hylBi6ohePI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prep for the next tournament at Clinton Lake has begun in earnest now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Located near Lawrence KS is the next stop for us on this adventure.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass Population&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clinton Lake &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Lake_(Kansas)&#34;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a smaller lake here in KS and one that I have never been to.  This is the second tourney in a row that I have never been to the lake at least once.  Add to that, my work schedule did not permit any practice time for this event or the last for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is @ksbigbass,  and as the name suggests,  I do live in Kansas and I am on the eternal search for more and Bigger bass !!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome&#34;&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While trying to teach myself how to do it Faster!  Fishing with a power finesse style that is unique to me and may not be exactly the way the magazines would tell you how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love to fish  Eakins Jigs  in the rocks in the local watering holes, but don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you find me with a swimbait tied to the end of my line!  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
