<h2 id="so-what-makes-a-better-ned-head">So what makes a better Ned Head?</h2>
<p>Or is it the constant snags we must endure when fishing around rocks and rip rap. Fishing the dam for smallmouth is a challenge, to say the least with the original Ned without the lightest of heads. I got things to do. Dealing with the wind blowing the lightweight jig head around isn&rsquo;t productive.</p>
<h3 id="the-weight-of-the-jig-head-is-important">The weight of the jig head is important.</h3>
<p>The Zman plastic floats the tail of the bait of the bottom, too heavy of a jig head and that doesn&rsquo;t happen as well. This subtle, finesse presentation can produce quantity and quality catches, especially when the bass is pressured/finicky and unwilling to chase power fishing presentations such as crankbaits, spinner baits, topwater, and other moving baits. </p>

<p>And a weedguard choice.</p>

<p>There are a few different thought patterns for weed guards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each seems to have areas that are better than others and is anglers choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Single light wire style or the Texas rig style heads. For Finesse tactics around grass, brush, and laydowns without constant snagging and fouling the hook and spooking fish.</p>
