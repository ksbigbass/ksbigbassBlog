<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you see a head in the water, arms flailing, and a boat running, it&rsquo;s a bad situation,&rdquo; said James.</p>
<p>James Niggemeyer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They came upon a man and his toddler son in the water and their boat was still under power and heading right toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James put the boat we were in, his boat, in front of it,&rdquo; said Russ. &ldquo;I tried to do everything I could to stop it, but it rammed James&rsquo; boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russ was Johnny on the spot,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;It was like Baywatch, he jumped in there, killed the ignition and grabbed the boy.&rdquo; &hellip;.</p>
<p>The boy had a life jacket on, his dad didn&rsquo;t, according to the fishermen.</p>
<p>Way to Be James!! Keep up the good work!</p>
