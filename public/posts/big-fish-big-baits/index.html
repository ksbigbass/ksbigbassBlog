<p>&ldquo;Big fish like big baits, especially in the summertime,&rdquo; he said, then confirmed that he’d have thrown even larger worms if he could have found some.</p>
<h4 id="he-did-his-damage-on-tapering-points-that-abutted-the-river-channel">He did his damage on tapering points that abutted the river channel.</h4>
<p>[<img src="/images/Zoom-ol-monster-worm-300x77.jpg" alt="">]</p>
<p>Professional bass angler Stacey King Put a Hurtin&rsquo; on the competition with a monster 13&quot; worm.</p>
<p>Rig big 10 inch plus worms with a Gamakatsu EWG 5/0 or bigger hook. Use a heavier weight to get it down deep to the 20ft plus for summer fish at Table Rock. Peg it with a tungsten bass casting sinker to get the best feel of the bottom structure. Fished on a Carolina rig and weightless also works very well on deep flats or submerged humps and islands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being summer time the big jigs, carolina rigged worms and lizards are great places to start with on main lake points.</p>
