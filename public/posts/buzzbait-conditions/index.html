<h3 id="when-to">When to:</h3>
<p>Low skies, low light, and a slightly cooler day than you&rsquo;ve been having, the topwater bite turns on</p>
<p>Shallow fish are using shallow water cover, the buzzbait will flush them out.</p>
<p>For drawing fish out of heavy cover in both stained and clear water</p>
<p>Anywhere you can locate wood or vegetation</p>
<p>Light winds to flat calm</p>

<p>I prefer a single blade white or black but that&rsquo;s me, I sometimes will tip it with a fluke or some other type of spinnerbait trailer, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to run it with just the skirt and no trailer.  If you ask KVD he would always have a trailer hook on it.</p>
<h2 id="water-temperature-guide">Water Temperature Guide</h2>
<h3 id="spring">Spring</h3>
<p>Mid- to high 40s and on the upswing</p>
<h3 id="summer">Summer</h3>
<p>Any</p>
<h3 id="fall">Fall</h3>
<p>Until below about 50°F  </p>
<p>Topwaters that appeal to smallmouth may not necessarily appeal to largemouth.  A buzzbait,  I think is one of those lures that appeals to both species and throw spotted bass in there too for that matter.</p>
<p>Gotta get back to prep. Hope this helps you out on your next adventure to the lake and you get to enjoy the explosive feeling when that giant largemouth bass comes crashing out of her hiding spot and crushes that noisy critter coming overhead.</p>
