<p>Call it a Chatter-Bait or a Chaturbate or a Chatturbait I&rsquo;ve heard all the names, the general name is vibrating blade bait or a bladed swim jig.</p>

<h3 id="cast-to-target-and-begin-retrieve-like-a-crankbait">Cast to target and begin retrieve like a crankbait.</h3>
<p>6.x Gear Ratio Quality Reel - I like the Shimano Curado DC.</p>
<h3 id="when-a-fish-bites">When a fish bites</h3>
<p>Allow the fish to load the rod up under its own weight and continue to wind the reel.</p>
<p>Use a sweep style hookset while continuing to wind the reel to the side instead of pulling up and yanking. This will use the weight of the fish to bury the hook on itself without letting the blade to wedge open its mouth and pull the bait away, losing a fish.</p>

<p>Created by Z-MAN Chatterbait is their brand name but several different varieties exist.

<p>Variations include where the line ties to the blade or the way the blade attaches to the hook, some of the jig heads wobble independently as well.</p>
<h3 id="strike-king-pure-poison">Strike King Pure Poison</h3>
<p>Very popular with professional anglers on the pro bass fishing tours. Slightly different shape to the blade causing different swimming action than the original.</p>
