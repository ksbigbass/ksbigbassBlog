<p>Clinton Lake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Lake_(Kansas)">Wiki</a></p>
<p>This is a smaller lake here in KS and one that I have never been to.  This is the second tourney in a row that I have never been to the lake at least once.  Add to that, my work schedule did not permit any practice time for this event or the last for that matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had high hopes of making the 3hr drive this week to get a little look around the lake, unfortunately that was unable to take place, as of yet&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lake  has 23 different species of fish in it according to the KDWP and the Corps.  </p>
<p>Largemouth are more predominant</p>
<p>Smallmouth bass are listed in the literature after a little more digging.</p>
<p>I can only guess the weights to win are gonna be 15 lbs and it will be largemouth that win it.</p>
<p>Water temps are unclear to me right now, found 60 degrees on <a href="https://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/Locations/District-Lakes/Clinton-Lake/">Corps</a> site but with 100 degree temps next 2-3 days could really heat things up!</p>
<p>Stay tuned &hellip;</p>
