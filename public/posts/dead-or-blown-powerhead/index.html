<p>Had just put the 2004 519VX Comanche Ranger in the water at my favorite place, Table Rock lake in Missouri, when the idle of my 200hp Mercury Optimax started acting a little funny. Well it wasn&rsquo;t long before she lost a little power on the top end and I knew there was a real problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had to make the decision a lot of us do, fix it or replace the boat? The boat works great, I like the hull, so I decided to fix it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-search">The Search</h3>
<p>Not having a competent boat shop around me I went to the internet to find a solution to my problem. I found remanufactured motors on Ebay and other places. Found places that specialized in rebuilds but took my core and gave me someone else&rsquo;s. All of these solutions had mixed ratings at best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was more comfortable keeping what I had and fixing it instead of possibly taking on someone else&rsquo;s problems.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There is of course going with a used motor, and a whole different set of questions I didn&rsquo;t want to answer, like having another dead powerhead in 6 months.</p>
<p>I decided to go with <a href="https://chriscarsonmarine.com/">ChrisCarsonMarine.com</a> who will rebuild the powerhead in house, machine work included, test/fix/replace any bad air, oil, fuel injectors, and all systems before shipping it back to me.</p>

<p>I found Chris from favorable reviews on Bass boat central and scream and fly.</p>
