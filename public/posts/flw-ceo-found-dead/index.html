<p>Orono Police Chief Correy Farniok said officers who responded to the Shoreline Drive home shortly after 8:30 a.m. found the bodies in a bed along with a gun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennis Mathisen, a longtime business associate of Irwin Jacobs, told the Star Tribune Wednesday afternoon that Irwin killed his wife and then himself. Both were 77.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mathisen said Alexandra Jacobs &ldquo;had been in a wheelchair for the last year or so and had signs of dementia. Irwin was just distraught over her condition.&rdquo; According to the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/irwin-jacobs-wife-dead-in-murder-suicide-twin-cities-businessman/508373492/">StarTribune</a></p>
