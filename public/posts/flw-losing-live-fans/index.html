<h2 id="is-the-flw-losing-fans">Is the FLW losing fans?</h2>
<p>As I sit here watching both the MLF Bass Pro Tour on one screen and BASS on another I wonder, why isn&rsquo;t FLW broadcasting live?</p>
<p>BASS is at Winyah Bay with live fishing all weekend starting on Thursday.</p>
<p>MLF is at Chickamauga Lake and started their live broadcast Tuesday and will continue all weekend.</p>
<p>FLW is at Cherokee Reservoir Jefferson City, TN, and won&rsquo;t start live broadcasting until Saturday and then only 4 hrs. With an additional 4 hrs on Sunday. 8 full hours total.</p>
<p>With such a lack of on the water live streaming at a time when the competition is creating so much awesome content, will they be able to survive the future? Will they slowly drift off into irrelevancy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fight for viewership is on hot and heavy between 2 not 3 it seems.</p>
