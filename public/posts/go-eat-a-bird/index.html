The story goes like this. Guy has a fast bass boat like a lot of us do. Running loaded down fairly well on a lake with heavy boat traffic that day. The pair were flying down the lake headed off to the next spot. That is when a group of coots surprisingly came out of nowhere. One of the biggest and slowest birds hit the trolling motor with the boat going about 70 miles and hour. Another bird hit the console and then hit the driver directly in the face.">

<h4 id="eat-that-bird">Eat that Bird</h4>
<p>The passenger didn&rsquo;t have a mask on and sustained some facial lacerations and got to eat a bird but the guy driving the boat had on his Save Phace Mask. That caused the bird to ricochet off. Without hurting him.</p>
<h2 id="probably-saved-their-life">Probably saved their life.</h2>
<p>If that bird hit him in the face and knocked him out, it would of been a much different outcome for both and maybe other boaters or someone from your family.</p>
<p>That is why I always run around the lake with my Save Phace on and I always have a spare for my partner. I don&rsquo;t want them to eat a bird, or get hit in the face with cold rain, that stings.</p>
