<p>From <a href="http://www.in-fisherman.com/editorial/the-ned-rig/156084">Ned Kedhe</a> author and contributor to In-fisherman magazine</p>

<blockquote>
<p> &ldquo;<em>There are 3 sizes of jig that we like to use for the Ned rig,” Kehde said. “At the lightest, we will throw a 1/32-ounce jig. The majority of the time, we use a 1/16-ounce jig which will cover most situations. Last, we fish a 3/32-ounce jig when it is either very windy or if we are trying to get our baits deeper.</em>”</p>

<p>Tip: Swim it with little hops to imitate fleeing prey.</p>
