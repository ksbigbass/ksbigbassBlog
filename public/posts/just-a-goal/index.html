<h2 id="for-those-of-you-that-do-thank-you">For those of you that do, Thank You! </h2>
<p>I try to write fresh and unique content, concentrating on the stuff I see from TOW (time on water).  TOW is precious: it&rsquo;s one of those things in life that cannot be replaced with anything else.</p>
<p>Reading my blog, <a href="https://www.bassmaster.com/">BassMaster</a>, and <a href="http://www.basswest.com/">BassWest</a> are going to help in your fishing, no doubt, but it&rsquo;s all about TOW.   Life doesn&rsquo;t always give us what we want and like my mom always told me, &ldquo;Nobody ever said life was fair!&rdquo;.  </p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-be-on-the-water-8-hours-a-day-5-days-a-week">I want to be on the water 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. </h2>
<p>I want to be a fishing guide at Table Rock Lake.  Some days I can see that goal coming closer and some days it just gets that much farther away.  Ike has said it best with &ldquo;Never Give Up!&rdquo;  and I keep his motto close to my heart.   </p>
<p>The 9 to 5 grind can be extremely hard on us at times and all we want to do is throw up our hands, cuss and holler, grab a fishing pole, and run to the lake. Times are tough for a lot of people right now.  </p>
<p>The cost of living keeps going up and paychecks aren&rsquo;t, which makes it a lot harder on the masses to get to the lake and get that TOW.  I know I have missed more than a weekend or two because of fuel prices, and I know I am not alone there.</p>
<h4 id="just-a-goal">Just A Goal</h4>
<p>So what is this blog about now that it&rsquo;s almost over?  Nothing.  Just bitching about not getting that TOW.</p>
<p>Bitching because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want my job to be meeting you at the dock at 6am tomorrow for a day on the Rock.</li>
<li>I sucked in practice this weekend for the upcoming tournament.</li>
<li>Now I have to think about that for 3 weeks before the tournament.</li>
<li>Three weeks!!! I didn&rsquo;t get skunked, but boy I sure stunk that lake up pretty bad!</li>
<li>I know a lot is gonna change in the next few weeks and transitioning to a fall pattern is a definite maybe.  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>TOW is precious, treat it as such.</em></p>
