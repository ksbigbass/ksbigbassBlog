Love a Jerkbait: Late fall is upon here like a big wet blanket.  Snows are starting to fall. Cool rains are filling those lakes and ponds that almost gave their lives this year.  
Kansas has been in a bad drought for a while and most of the lakes in KS have really taken it hard, so every little bit of rain is a graciously appreciated.

As those cold fall rains make it to the lakes, I think about the cooling waters and the fall jerkbait fishing that I find so fun.  ">

<p>&ldquo;I took it down the lake the third day to where I&rsquo;d been catching them,&rdquo; Thrift said. &ldquo;I was in 4 feet of water jerking the jerkbait just as hard as I could jerk it and they were knocking the paint off of it. It was ridiculous.&rdquo;    </p>

<p>There are days that the fish want that bait ripped and ripped hard.</p>
<p>Proven not to long ago when Pro Bryan Thrift was ripping the paint off the baits to get the big girls to play in the <a href="https://www.flwfishing.com/news/2017-05-01-top-10-patterns-from-beaver-lake">Beaver Lake FLW</a> back in March.</p>

<p>Before the end of the year I have high hopes to make it back to Table Rock to fish bluff walls for one last fling.  Filled with big ass spotted bass that are eager to slam that pointer when twitched by the tops of those trees.</p>
