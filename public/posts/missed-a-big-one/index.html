<p>Started with a custom painted Pop-r and had a nice 8 lber blow up on it.  Being my first cast of the day I choked and yanked it out of his mouth !  ARGH!!  Missed a Big One!</p>
<p>Being lunchtime and near high sun for the day I knew the large females would be haunting the shallow waters looking for a big meal and spot to make babies. I was right but dang it I hate it when I miss a big fish.</p>
<p>Ended up bagging a nice few keepers in the trip.  I did have a Nice buck show himself to me, guessing 6lbs, and I am sure he will bite my swimbait tomorrow&hellip;.lol.</p>

<p>These new poppers by Z-Man lure the Pop Shadz are starting to make a spot in my tackle box for fishing stuff where this popper gets hung up on weeds and grass. It has a little different look than a frog or a mouse and gets some looks. Check out the <a href="https://ksbigbass.com/z-man-pop-shadz-lures-review/">Pop Shadz</a> and a tip on rigging them.</p>
