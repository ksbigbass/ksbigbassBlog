<p>Check out these giant bass caught in Raleigh recently by the MLF pro&rsquo;s</p>

<p>They have modified it with a fish lip clip similar to the one below. This is a Fish Grip Jr.</p>
<p>[<img src="/images/fish-clip-MLF.jpg" alt="MLF Fish Clip">]</p>
<p>Provides less chance of injury to fisherman and the fish. Made of plastic and stainless steel and floats if lost in the water, besides that it easily stows into a kayak compartment nicely.</p>
