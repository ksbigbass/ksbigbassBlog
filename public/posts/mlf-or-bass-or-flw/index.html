And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.
This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch.

<p>And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.</p>
<p>This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?</p>
<p>Of course we are constantly looking for ways to enhance the experience for the fish with better live wells and release methods but isn&rsquo;t this the best one we&rsquo;ve come up with yet?</p>
<h2 id="conservation-aside-which-tournament-trail-is-your-favorite">Conservation aside which tournament trail is your favorite?</h2>
<p>MLF is gaining favortism with anglers for a good reason. Fast paced action most times. Quick thinking required to get on fish fast. Then top it off knowing when your competition is kicking your ass! Complaints are too many small fish and not a lot of giants caught or time spent trying to find them.</p>
<h3 id="bass-lost-a-lot-of-their-top-names-to-the-mlf">BASS lost a lot of their top names to the MLF.</h3>
<p>KVD being one of them. They have been the Tour to follow for me for quite a while and I will continue to watch. The live fishing coverage is constantly getting better and Zona is awesome at the commentary. I like seeing big fish being caught and appreciate the difficulty involved in bring in the biggest 5.</p>
<p>FLW also lost some of their big names to MLF. The allure of the new series and the TV coverage for their sponsorships undoubtedly played a large roll in the pros decisions. After all being a professional fisherman is %50 catching fish and winning tournaments and %50 selling fishing gear. More TV time means more sales to us suckers.</p>
<p>I love all three and each has its pluses and minuses and competition will ultimately end up creating a better products for us the consumers and lovers of all things bass fishing.</p>
