<p>Love to fish  Eakins Jigs  in the rocks in the local watering holes, but don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find me with a swimbait tied to the end of my line!  </p>
<p>I tournament fish lakes in Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma.</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.visittablerocklake.com/">Table Rock Lake</a> in Missouri is my favorite lake to fish.  </p>
<p>I have one of the largest fish of my life that came from the great lake.  10.5lbs caught on that Eakins jig I spoke of earlier  ;-)   That lake is Full of largemouth, spotted, and smallmouth bass, and a 50 fish day is not uncommon.   Maybe one day I will guide there in the future, have you as a guest in my boat.  </p>
<p>I currently am the Proud owner of a 1999 Triton TR-20 with a 200hp Mercury Optimax.   Beige with a forest   green stripe and grey interior.  </p>
<p>Currently have a Lowrance HDS-5 at the drivers console and a Lowrance 125 at the bow.  I also run a digital Motorguide 82lb thrust that I would love to upgrade to the 109 lbs.  </p>
<p>Is your fish finder lying to you?</p>
<p>The 40mph winds that I often encounter would be better tamed with the bigger motor but the 82 lbs does fine in most conditions.  </p>
