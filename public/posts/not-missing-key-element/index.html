Not Missing a Key Element


So I ask _&hellip;_How often are you throwing baits that imitate sunfish?
There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.">

<h2 id="so-i-ask__how-often-are-you-throwing-baits-that-imitate-sunfish">So I ask _&hellip;_How often are you throwing baits that imitate sunfish?</h2>
<p>There is a reason fish biologists use sunfish as the primary food source for bass when stocking a pond. It&rsquo;s as if bass live to eat them. Whether it&rsquo;s bluegill, green ear or red ear sunfish, rock bass or pumpkinseed, all of these fish play a critical role in the diet of most bass throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Sunfish build beds in relatively shallow water (2 to 4 feet deep) in the backs of pockets, around sandy secondary points, flats and especially boat docks. So as the warmer water approaches, many anglers head out to deeper water in search of summer patterns to entice bass, I like to grab a topwater and head for the gills.</p>
<h3 id="not-missing-a-key-element">Not Missing a Key Element</h3>
<p>Often just near the first drop off, next to the spawning areas is likely where you will find the bass. A lot of times that is when you will run into a large bass, more specifically some of the post-spawn females looking to fatten up! This is the time of year that those big sows will throw themselves out of the water with a vengeance to smash a gill painted sammy or popper.</p>
<p>So do like I did and refresh that tackle box with a splash of color and lure that big bass that&rsquo;s cruising for a gill.</p>
