<p>Ranger should have sent a notice to all owners of trailers in the affected years a detailed description on how to remove the road armor coating and a how-to for a proper inspection procedure. If not comfortable performing this inspection to take the trailer to the dealer or a competent welder.</p>

<p>Some symptoms could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tires wearing uneven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hubs failing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My advice is to have the welds checked on your trailers now before there is someone seriously injured.</p>
<p>I do want the owners to be aware of a potential problem and something to check before your next trip to the lake.</p>
