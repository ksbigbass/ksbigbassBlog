<p> Taking off early in the morning tomorrow to go get in some much need practice time.</p>
<p>The KDWP on <a href="https://ksoutdoors.com/State-Parks/Locations/Clinton">Clinton Lake</a>.</p>
<p>I have made the promise to my partner to keep my foot on the trolling motor and keep the boat moving.   Only spending enough time to get a good look with the Lowrance and then moving on to the next spot.</p>
<p>Although, there are more smallmouth in this lake than I previously thought,  I can only believe that the 18&quot; slot on the Largemouth could play a huge part in the game.  A lot of guys in this derby could be out chasing the 18.+&quot; largemouth that are rumored to be  few and far between, while the guys with a limit of smallmouth and a smaller slot of 15&quot; but five of them.</p>
<p>Or maybe things are primed for a Big sack of females to be plucked off there beds.  I guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>If I can come close to answering just one of those questions tomorrow I will feel like I have made an accomplishment.  </p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s time to go rerig some rods and get ready to go. I found this little tool that Kelly Jordan made up that really makes that task easier. Restringing the line through the guides and I always seem to drop the line. It falls all the way back down to the ground and makes me restart the process all over. This little tool solves that problem.</p>
