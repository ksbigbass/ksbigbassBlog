Have you heard about Shimano&rsquo;s Curado DC? A baitcasting reel from Shimano with a digital controller built into it to prevent backlashes.
Spinnerbaits and skipping jigs under boat docks are notorious for backlashes on conventional baitcasters, this reel tackles that problem.
The controller monitors the spool speed 1,000 times every second and applies brakes to prevent overruns.
Mono Capacity - 10/120 12/110 14/90

Weighs 7.8 OZ
LOW-PROFILE
6&#43;1 Bearings
6.2 Gear Ratio
11 lbs Max Drag

Anglers of all skill levels will appreciate less thumbing and trouble-free casting in all conditions.">

<h2 id="does-it-work">Does it Work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I really like it for spinnerbaits into the wind. It does a great job at controlling reel blowups when the wind grabs a blade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It excels at throwing baits with some weight to them like a rattle trap, but can easily be dialed in to throw a Senko too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="it-does-have-a-learning-curve">It does have a learning curve.</h3>
<p>I tend to have a flick in my casting technique that really accelerates the spool speed at the end of the cast. This has caused headaches and terrible backlashes, maybe worse than a standard baitcaster at times. A consistent speed in casting is needed or the reel gets very mad and so will you, I would expect.</p>
<h3 id="takes-a-few-casts-to-charge-the-battery">Takes a few casts to charge the battery.</h3>
<p>Be careful the first few casts as it needs time to charge up the battery before it works. Admittedly, I have forgotten this in the beginning and had a few nasty starts to the day.</p>
