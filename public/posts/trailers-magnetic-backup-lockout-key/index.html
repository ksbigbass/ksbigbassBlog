<h3 id="most-modern-trailers-have-a-surge-brake-to-assist-with-the-heavy-load-of-the-boat-in-tow">Most modern trailers have a surge brake to assist with the heavy load of the boat in tow.</h3>
<p>The surge brake is operated by a 5 pin connector with the fifth pin controlling the reverse lights and the backup solenoid. This system works great when the driver places the truck in reverse it sends a signal to the solenoid to engage.</p>
<p>This causes the brakes to be unlocked when weight is against the trailer tongue and hydraulic braking system.</p>
<h4 id="locked-up-trailer-tires-when-backing-up-a-hill-is-a-clear-indication-these-systems-arent-functioning-properly-when-the-vehicle-is-placed-in-reverse">Locked up trailer tires when backing up a hill is a clear indication these systems aren&rsquo;t functioning properly when the vehicle is placed in reverse.</h4>
<p>Most of the tools of this type slide into the hydraulic cylinder to lock it in the back position but often fall out if you need to reposition the vehicle. You pull forward and releases the pressure off the old style keys and they fall out. Causing you to have to get out of the truck and try to get it back in. Usually, it takes a couple of tries to get it right.</p>
<h2 id="corrosion-at-the-pins-is-usually-the-culprit">Corrosion at the pins is usually the culprit.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Check the back of the trucks wiring connector plug and make sure the wires or pins are seated correctly. Reseat the wires with dielectric grease to resist corrosion.</p>

<p>This new magnetic key is the ticket and an easy fix. Wished I had found this thing a long time ago for the glove box. Would have saved a ton of headaches.</p>
