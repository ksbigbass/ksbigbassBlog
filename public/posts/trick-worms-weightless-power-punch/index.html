7lber on the NRX 803S JWR drop shot rod and weightless trick worm

Trick worms are my go to bait.
The trick worm is almost always rigged weightless and wacky style when I fish it. I prefer to use Seaguar Finesse 6.2 lb line to get the absolute perfect presentation. Cast out and let the worm sink, watching the line for a strike indication at all times. Often times a very subtle twitch will cause the ends of the worm to flair every so slightly and an absolute natural looking presentation.">

<p>The trick worm is almost always rigged weightless and wacky style when I fish it. I prefer to use Seaguar Finesse 6.2 lb line to get the absolute perfect presentation. Cast out and let the worm sink, watching the line for a strike indication at all times. Often times a very subtle twitch will cause the ends of the worm to flair every so slightly and an absolute natural looking presentation.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of stick baits out there in all shapes and sizes. Senko&rsquo;s remain popular over the years because they catch fish all around the country. Heavier in salt than the trick worm they tend to cast well, but tear easily.</p>
<h3 id="which-hook-to-use">Which hook to use.</h3>
<p>There are a ton of drop shot, finesse hooks on the market and more coming all the time. I&rsquo;m always looking and trying others but the Gamakatsu drop shot / split shot hook is perfect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I kept thinking that there was a better hook and kept searching and searching, but Gammy builds the best in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tons-of-5lb-fish-and-a-few-around-8lbs-on-the-size-10-hooks">Tons of 5lb fish and a few around 8lbs on the size 1/0 hooks.</h3>
<p>I have used the Gammy finesse wide gaps to Mustad with the little nylon weed guards and you can keep them all!  I have lost more fish on those than I like to think about.  </p>

<p>Tie it to your favorite spinning combo paired with some Seaguar 6lb fluorocarbon line and head for the spawning areas and get ready for some serious fun!!                        </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I love the Trick Worm so much.  It&rsquo;s a well known bait and should be in your top ten. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s used in the weightless presentations, as much.  It is used quite heavily on the DS rig and a lot of guys will even put it on a Carolina rig.  But I think it&rsquo;s often overlooked as a weightless stickbait. Maybe it&rsquo;s because it doesn&rsquo;t cast well on 20lb mono lol&hellip;</p>
