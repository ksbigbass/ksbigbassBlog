<p>What&rsquo;s on that graph? Fishing graphs are absolutely amazing pieces of hardware. Think about the abuse these things take. You would never leave an Ipad sitting outside in the temperature extremes you do with your fish finder. Much less strap it to the extreme environment of a boat going down the lake at 70 + mph.

<p>Most pics are courtesy of @LTBama wherever he is now. Thank You.</p>
<p>I prefer a basic metal spoon or a drop shot rig for this technique and 8 lb Seaguar Tatsu.</p>

<p>Cabela&rsquo;s RealImage Jig-N-Spoon works extremely well.</p>

<p>Tip: The glow color is great fish catcher.</p>

<p>Here is a fish being caught.</p>
<p>The two zigzag lines are the anglers fishing line and his bait.</p>

<p>This is fish everywhere. Swimming fast through the graphs transducer.</p>
<p>Chasing bait. This are the types of pictures that clearly show pandamonium. The bass are actively chasing the bait and feeding heavily in this picture. Just getting a spoon to them almost guarantees a bite in these frothy conditions.</p>

<p>More schooling fish with a little more clarity.</p>
<p>Look close for the anglers spoon entering into the picture just off center to the right.</p>
<p>Seeing this kind of striping on the graph presents anglers with an excellent opportunity.</p>

<p>These are hungry bass waiting to feed. The have the shad hovering near the bottom in a tight school for defense.</p>
<p>A dozen or so bass are just sitting above them waiting for the diner bell. Anglers may try to get this school to feed with a presentation and might fire the school up, but currently there isn&rsquo;t much action here.</p>

<p>Well there ya go.</p>
<p>Over the past few years there have been tremendous advances in these fish graphs. New manufacturers entering the market and new technologies coming along frequently. Before a boat may have a Lowrance X68 and be good for 5 years or so.</p>
<p>Now new models that are bigger and faster arrive weekly it feels like.</p>
<p>Fish finders will continue to advance. New technologies are being developed daily. Bright new colors and even sports or weather on them now if you want. New features, old gig.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve included a link below for the latest software updates for your fish finders, or get a <a href="https://amzn.to/2HVybHI">new Lowrance</a> today, now that you know what your looking at.</p>
