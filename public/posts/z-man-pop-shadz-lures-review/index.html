    <meta name="description" content="Z-MAN Pop Shadz Lures Review: This bait has a tendency to want to walk around on the hook. The trick to rigging this bait is to use a toothpick through the eye of the hook to hold it in place. This eliminates the bait moving around and causing headaches and anger.
Z-MAN Pop Shadz Lures is the latest in weedless topwaters.
Once the issue of the bait sliding down is resolved it will produce some nice fish for you. The weedless design makes it easy to throw it in areas you might be hesitant to throw a popper type bait with dangling treble hooks catching everything but bass. The Z-Man elastic design is tough and floats well. Very durable for sure. The light weight however can cause headaches casting into the wind on casting gear. The new Shimano Curado DC and its digital micro controller for the spool speed definitely helps out on backlashes for that situation.">

<h4 id="great-for-deadsticking">Great for deadsticking:</h4>
<p>Z-Man elastec super plastic floats so well, the entire bait is out of the water, tail and all. This is great ultra still presentation for bedding bass that are in shallow water and are extremely spooky. In open water you can try to add a treble hook to the EWG to add a second way of hooking fish or just to drag the tail down into the water more for a little more action.</p>
