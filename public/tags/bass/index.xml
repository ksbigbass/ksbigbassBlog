      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is FLW losing the race for live view fans? More importantly are they losing the fight for fans?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Social media is full of fans that want to watch live streaming bass fishing! We Love Bass Fishing! Streaming live fishing is quickly becoming an addiction for some, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-the-flw-losing-fans&#34;&gt;Is the FLW losing fans?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I sit here watching both the MLF Bass Pro Tour on one screen and BASS on another I wonder, why isn&amp;rsquo;t FLW broadcasting live?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlf-or-bass-or-flw-the-new-season-is-here&#34;&gt;MLF or BASS or FLW: The new season is here!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&amp;rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
