      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches: Google Search Trends showed a big surge in bass fishing related search terms back in 2004 for Alaska. The graph spikes at 100. Instinct tells me this was more for a search for Rock Bass or Striped Bass versus largemouth or smallmouth bass. Either way interesting information for you to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;alaska-number-1-in-bass-fishing-searches&#34;&gt;Alaska: Number 1 in Bass Fishing Searches&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Catching giant striped bass or giant trout on a fly line would be a blast if you ask me. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait for my first trip to the winding rustic rivers of Alaska to catch some giants on a Spey rod!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I went into fishing these buddy tournaments with apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would they be good ‘ole boys with a case of Bud in one hand and Zebco in the other or would they be guys as competitive as me? Let me tell you, I was happy to find out these guys are ultra-competitive. They’ll put a whoopin’ on you in a heartbeat and not think twice about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
