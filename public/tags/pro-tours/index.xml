      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlf-or-bass-or-flw-the-new-season-is-here&#34;&gt;MLF or BASS or FLW: The new season is here!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a lot of changes have taken place over the off season. Seems like the new format of the MLF has taken over the bass fishing world. All the top level tour events have adopted some sort of catch and release system or soon will for the tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is great for the conservation of the species and will cut down on mortality rates for sure. There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that riding around in a livewell for up to 8 hours and then being put into weigh-in bags and flopped on a scale can be harmful to the days catch. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me you might miss the slaunches being held up on stage and the dramatic endings of the weigh-ins but doesn&amp;rsquo;t the long term health of the bass deserve more than that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
