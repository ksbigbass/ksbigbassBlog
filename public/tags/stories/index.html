<p>The ordinary objects of resin, fiberglass thread, and bits of steel when combined can be used as an extraordinary tool to provide food for a family or it can transform a life through incommensurable ways.</p>
<p>The origin of the fishing pole dates back about as far as history itself, first depicted in stone inscriptions found in Egypt, China, and Medieval England. Made from cane growing beside the river, a line was fashioned to the tip with a hook fabricated out of bone and tied to the end. Small worms, insects, minnows and frogs from the river were used as bait. Cane poles are as flexible as a gymnast and strong as an ox and can be made very long to reach farther out into the river with the bait. They were so productive at catching fish they are still sold at your local Walmart.</p>
