      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-sure-feels-like-a-couple-of-hot-girls-are-fighting-over-me-vying-for-all-my-attention&#34;&gt;This sure feels like a couple of hot girls are fighting over me, vying for all my attention.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had three chasing me but 1 of them was beaten up by a big bully. She&amp;rsquo;s trying to get all cleaned up and get back in the game, but she&amp;rsquo;s always kinda been the 3rd choice anyway&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big bully bought off one of them, stole half of the other&amp;rsquo;s stuff, just like he does with his baits, and is attempting to take over the pond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;fishing-for-a-smile&#34;&gt;Fishing for a smile&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ordinary objects of resin, fiberglass thread, and bits of steel when combined can be used as an extraordinary tool to provide food for a family or it can transform a life through incommensurable ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the fishing pole dates back about as far as history itself, first depicted in stone inscriptions found in Egypt, China, and Medieval England. Made from cane growing beside the river, a line was fashioned to the tip with a hook fabricated out of bone and tied to the end. Small worms, insects, minnows and frogs from the river were used as bait. Cane poles are as flexible as a gymnast and strong as an ox and can be made very long to reach farther out into the river with the bait. They were so productive at catching fish they are still sold at your local Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a Goal…. I need to deviate from my normal fishing talk for a second.  I have been writing this blog for a few months now and am still amazed that anyone actually reads it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-those-of-you-that-do-thank-you&#34;&gt;For those of you that do, Thank You! &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try to write fresh and unique content, concentrating on the stuff I see from TOW (time on water).  TOW is precious: it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things in life that cannot be replaced with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;End of a Marathon: Sure we all have had one of those days.   Well today was Tourney day.   After a long day of work Friday we ended up in Lawrence around 9pm, just in time to find out it was KU&amp;rsquo;s Graduation Weekend.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;end-of-a-marathon-have-you-ever-had-one-of-those-days-where-things-went-wrong&#34;&gt;End of a Marathon: Have you ever had one of those days where things went wrong.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-scramble-was-on-to-find-a-hotel-room&#34;&gt;The scramble was on to find a hotel room!  &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First stop was a no-go, and we quickly came to the realization that we might be spending the night in the truck at the ramp.  As luck would have it the very first hotel  we called had an available room.  We promptly made it to our room after check in and settled in ready for the derby wake up at 04:30.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
