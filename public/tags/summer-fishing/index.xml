      <description>&lt;p&gt;Re:The Hotter The Better: I fish all year round, weather conditions of all types. Here in Kansas, my current stomping grounds, the winters can be brutally cold, and the summers are hot. Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s forecast is 110 degrees with 80%+ humidity..aaarrggghhh. A lot of the summer bass fishing articles talk about going deep, not this one. I am going to talk about fishing shallow with 90+ degree surface water temps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;946-degrees&#34;&gt;94.6 degrees&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was the surface water temp last weekend, air temps where 106+ during the day and already 86 degrees at 5am on our way to the lake.  It was gonna be an extremely hot day but with a 20mph wind to help it would be bearable.  Hydration is talked about a lot for a good reason!  A day like that without a gallon of Gatorade in you and a severe heat stroke situation is truly possible.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen to many hospitals located lake side either&amp;hellip;just a friendly reminder&amp;hellip;Drink UP!  Might just save your life.  Back to the story and off the soap box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
