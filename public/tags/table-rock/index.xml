      <description>&lt;p&gt;Big fish like big baits: Table Rock Lake is known for its spotted bass population as well as the quality largemouth and some giant smallmouth that show up from time to time. I&amp;rsquo;ve caught the biggest spotted bass of my life fishing there. As well as some picture worthy smallmouth. This is shaping up to be a great tournament with the largemouth bass on fire right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;big-fish-like-big-baits-home-of-the-professional-anglers-association&#34;&gt;Big fish like big baits: Home of the Professional Anglers Association&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Home of the Professional Anglers Association&lt;/p&gt;</description>
